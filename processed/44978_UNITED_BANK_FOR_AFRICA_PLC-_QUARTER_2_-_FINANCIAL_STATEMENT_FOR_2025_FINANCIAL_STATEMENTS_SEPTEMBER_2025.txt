3 Material accounting policies
3.1 Basis of measurement
These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following:
- Derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value.
- Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.
- Financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
3.2 Functional and presentation currency

3.4 Basis of consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries (including structured entities) are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has rights to variable returns from its
involvementinanentityandhastheabilitytoaffectthosereturnsthroughitspowerovertheentity.TheGroupalsoassessesexistenceofcontrolwhereit
doesnothavemorethan50%ofthevotingpowerbutisabletogovernthefinancialandoperatingpoliciesbyvirtueofde-factocontrol.Subsidiariesare
fully consolidated from the date in which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.
Theaccountingpoliciesofsubsidiarieshavebeenchanged,wherenecessary,toalignwiththepoliciesadoptedbytheGroup.Lossesapplicabletothe
non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests.
In the separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment.
(b) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the total of:
· the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus
· theamountofanynon-controllinginterestintheacquiree;plusifthebusinesscombinationisachievedinstages,thefairvalueoftheexistingequity
interest in the acquiree;
· less the net amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When this total is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised in profit or loss.
Non-controllinginterestsaremeasuredattheirproportionateshareoftheacquiree'sidentifiablenetassetsattheacquisitiondate.ChangesintheGroup's
interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Costsrelatedtotheacquisition,otherthanthoseassociatedwiththeissueofdebtorequitysecuritiesthattheGroupincursinconnectionwithabusiness
combination are expensed as incurred.
Ifthebusinesscombinationisachievedinstages,theacquisitiondatecarryingvalueofanypreviouslyheldequityinterestintheacquireeisre-measured

Anycontingentconsiderationpayableisrecognisedatfairvalueattheacquisitiondate.Ifthecontingentconsiderationisclassifiedasequity,itisnot
remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are
recognised in profit or loss.

3.6 Interest income and interest expense
Interestincome andexpense for all interest bearing financial instruments arecalculated byapplying the effective interestrate tothe gross carrying
amountfornon-creditimpairedfinancial assetsand arerecognisedwithin‘interestincome’and ‘interestexpense’inthe profitor loss.Theeffective
interestrateistheratethatexactlydiscountstheestimatedfuturecashpaymentsandreceiptsthroughtheexpectedlifeofthefinancialassetorliability
(or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.
Forcredit-impairedfinancialassetssubsequenttoinitialrecognition,interestincomeiscalculatedbyapplyingthecredit-adjustedeffectiveinterestrateto
the amortised cost of the financial asset.
The calculation of the effective interest rate includes all transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.
Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability.
For purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets, the Group calculates interest income by calculating the credit-adjusted EIR and
applying that rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. The credit-adjusted EIR is the interest rate that, at initial recognition, discounts the estimated
future cash flows (including credit losses) to the amortised cost of the POCI financial asset

Immediately before classification as held for sale or distribution, the assets are re-measured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.
Thereafter generally the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
3.18 Repossessed collateral
Repossessed collateral represents financial and non-financial assets acquired by the Group in settlement of overdue loans. The assets are initially
recognisedatfairvaluewhenacquiredandincludedintherelevantassetsdependingonthenatureandtheGroup'sintentioninrespectofrecoveryof

The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale
transaction ratherthan through continuinguse.Non-currentassets and disposal groups classified asheldfor sale are measuredat the lower of their

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the Group (issuer) to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs
because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.

Short term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term employee benefits if the Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
3.23 Share capital and reserves
(a) Share issue costs
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of an equity instrument are deducted from the initial measurement of the equity instruments.
(b) Dividend on ordinary shares
Dividends on the Group’s ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are paid or, if earlier, approved by the Group’s shareholders.
(c) Treasury shares
Where the Group or any member of the Group purchases the Group’s shares, the consideration paid is deducted from the shareholders’ equityas

The Grouppresents basic earningsper share (EPS) for its ordinaryshares.Basic EPSis calculated by dividingthe profitor loss attributable toordinary
shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

TheGroupdeterminesthebusinessmodelsatthelevelthatbestreflectshowportfoliosoffinancialassetsaremanaged toachievetheGroup'sbusiness
objectives. Judgment is used in determining the business models, which is supported by relevant, objective evidence including:
•Howtheeconomicactivitiesofourbusinessesgeneratebenefits,forexamplethroughtradingrevenue,enhancingyieldsorothercostsandhowsuch
economic activities are evaluated and reported to key management personnel;
• The significant risks affecting the performance of our businesses, for example, market risk, credit risk, or other risks and the activities undertaken to
manage those risks; and
• Historical and future expectations of sales of the loans or securities portfolios managed as part of a business model.
The Group's business models fall into three categories, which are indicative of the key strategies used to generate returns:
•Hold-to-Collect(HTC):Theobjectiveofthisbusinessmodelistoholdfinancialassetstocollectcontractualprincipalandinterestcashflows.Salesare
incidental to this objective and are expected to be insignificant or infrequent.

are transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Loans at below-market interest rates are classified as financial instruments and accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments. At initial
recognition, such loans are measured at fair value, being the present value of future contractual cash flows discounted at the prevailing market interest
rate for a similar instrument with comparable credit risk and terms.
The difference between the transaction price (amount advanced or received) and the fair value at initial recognition is accounted for as follows:
• Loans granted (below market rate): The difference is recognized immediately in profit or loss as an expense (e.g., employee benefit expense)
• Loans received (below market rate): The difference is recognized as income, which may be presented in accordance with IAS 20 if the loan represents
a government grant, or as other income if received from other parties

An expected credit loss estimate is produced for each individual exposure. Relevant parameters are modelled on a collective basis using portfolio
segmentation (corporates, retail, public sector and commercial) that allows for appropriate incorporation of forward looking information.
Expected credit losses are discounted to the reporting period date using the effective interest rate.

l. Definition of default
A default is considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both of the following events have taken place.
•Thebankconsidersthattheobligorisunlikelytopayitscreditobligationsinfull,withoutrecoursebythebanktoactionssuchasrealisingsecurity(if

•Theobligorispastduemorethan90daysonanymaterialcreditobligationtothebank(principalorinterest).Overdraftswillbeconsideredasbeing
past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than current outstanding.
• Interest payments equal to 90 days or more have been capitalized, rescheduled, rolled overinto a new loan (except wherefacilities have been
reclassified).
The elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay include:
- The bank sells the credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss.
-Thebankconsentstoadistressedrestructuringofthecreditobligationwherethisislikelytoresultinadiminishedfinancialobligationcausedbythe
material forgiveness, or postponement, of principal, interest or (where relevant) fees.
- The bank has filed for the obligor’s bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of the obligor’s credit obligation to the banking group.
The following are considered as exceptions:
a. Outstanding obligation is a result of an amount being disputed between the bank and obligor where the dispute is not more than 150 days;

of the borrower or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
Aloanisconsideredfortransferfromstage2tostage1wherethereissignificantimprovementincreditriskandfromstage3tostage2(declassified)
where the facility is no longer in default. Factors that are considered in such backward transitioning include the following:
i) Declassification of the exposure by all the licensed private credit bureaux or the credit risk management system;
ii) Improvement of relevant credit risk drivers for an individual obligor (or pool of obligors);
iii) Evidence of full repayment of principal or interest.
Generally,theabovearetorepresentanimprovementincreditrisktowarrantconsiderationforabackwardtransitionofloans.Wherethereisevidence
of significant reduction in credit risk, the following probationary periods should apply before a loan may be moved to a lower stage (indicating lower risk):
Transfer from Stage 2 to 1:- 90 days
Transfer from Stage 3 to 2:- 90 days
Transfer from Stage 3 to Stage 1:- 180 days
Whenafinancialassethasbeenidentifiedascredit-impaired,expectedcreditlossesaremeasuredasthedifferencebetweentheasset’sgrosscarrying
amountandthepresentvalueofestimatedfuturecashflowsdiscountedattheinstrument’soriginaleffectiveinterestrate.Forimpairedfinancialassets
with drawn and undrawn components, expected credit losses also reflect any credit losses related to the portion of the loan commitment that is
expected to be drawn down over the remaining life of the instrument.
When a financial asset is credit-impaired, interest ceases to be recognised on the regularaccrual basis,which accruesincome based on the gross
carryingamountoftheasset.Rather,interestincomeiscalculatedbyapplyingtheoriginaleffectiveinterestratetotheamortisedcostoftheasset,which
is the gross carrying amount less the related ACL.
Following impairment, interest income is recognized on the unwinding of the discount from the initial recognition of impairment.
n. Purchase or Originated Credit Impaired Assets
Purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI) assets are financial assets that are credit impaired on initial recognition. POCI assets are recorded at fair
value at original recognition and interest income is subsequently recognised based on a credit-adjusted EIR. The ECL allowance is only recognised or
released to the extent that there is a subsequent change in the expected credit losses
POCI assets are financial assets that are credit impaired on initial recognition. The Group only recognises the cumulative changes in lifetime ECL since
initial recognition, based on a probability-weighting of the four scenarios, discounted by the credit-adjusted EIR.

p. Modifications
Thecreditriskofafinancialassetwillnotnecessarilydecreasemerelyasaresultofamodificationofthecontractualcashflows.Ifthecontractualcash
flowsonafinancialassethavebeenrenegotiatedormodifiedandthefinancialassetwasnotderecognised,theBankassesseswhethertherehasbeen
a significant increase in the credit risk of the financial by comparing:
(1) the risk of a default occurring at the reporting date (based on the modified contractual terms); and
(2) the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition (based on the original, unmodified contractual terms).
A modification will however lead to derecognition of existing loan and recognition of a new loan i.e. substantial modification if:
•thediscountedpresentvalueofthecashflowsunderthenewterms,includinganyfeesreceivednetofanyfeespaidanddiscountedusingtheoriginal
effective interest rate, is at least 10 per cent different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial asset.
The following will be applicable to modified financial assets:
• The modification of a distressed asset is treated as an originated credit-impaired asset requiring recognition of life-time ECL after modification.
•Thecumulativechangesinlifetimeexpectedcreditlossessinceinitialrecognitionisrecognizedasalossallowanceforpurchaseororiginatedcredit-
impaired financial asset at the reporting date.
• The general impairment model does not apply to purchased or originated credit-impaired assets.
The following situations (qualitative) may however not lead to a derecognition of the loan:
• Change in interest rate arising from a change in MPR which is the benchmark rate that drives borrowing rates in Nigeria;
• Change in financial asset’s tenor (increase or decrease);
• Change in installment amount to higher or lower amount;
• Change in the annuity repayment pattern, for example, from monthly to quarterly, half-yearly or yearly
• Change in the applicable financial asset fee
Modification gain or loss is included as part of allowance for credit loss for each financial year.
q. Classification and measurement of financial liabilities
The Group recognizes financial liabilities when it first becomes a party to the contractual rights and obligations in the relevant contracts.
Under IFRS 9, financial liabilities are either classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost or financial liabilities at FVTPL.
The Group classifies its financial liabilities as measured at amortised cost, except for:

The Group adopts a single measurement approach and recognizes right to use of assets and lease liability at commencement date of a lease contract.
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease

payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group usesits incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencementdate because the

these audited consolidated and separate financial statements. The Group has adopted these new amendments with initial date of application of
January 1 2025.
Amendments to IAS 21: Lack of Exchangeability
The IASB’s amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates require disclosure of information that enables users of financial
statements to understand the impact of a currency not being exchangeable. This is applied to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January
2025 and can be applied earlier.
The amendment specifies when a currency is exchangeable into another currency and when it is not, how an entity determines the exchange rate to
apply when a currency is not exchangeable, and require the disclosure of additional information when a currency is not exchangeable.

to adopt these standards at their respective effective dates. Commentaries on these new standards/amendments are provided below.
(a) Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments - Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7
In May 2024, the Board issued Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7), which:
i) Clarifies that a financial liability is derecognised on the ‘settlement date’, i.e., when the related obligation is discharged, cancelled, expires or the liability
otherwise qualifies for derecognition. It also introduces an accounting policy option to derecognise financial liabilities that are settled through an
electronic payment system before settlement date if certain conditions are met.
ii) Clarified how to assess the contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets that include environmental, social and governance (ESG)-linked
features and other similar contingent features.
iii) Clarifies the treatment of non-recourse assets and contractually linked instruments.
iv) Requires additional disclosures in IFRS 7 for financial assets and liabilities with contractual terms that reference a contingent event (including those that
are ESG-linked), and equity instruments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income
This is applied to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2026 and can be applied earlier. This is not expected to have a significant
impact on the Group.
b) IFRS 18 – Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements
This standard is effective to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027.
In April 2024, the Board issued IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements which replaces IAS 1 Presentation in Financial Statements. IFRS
18 introduces new categories and subtotals in the statement of profit or loss. It also requires disclosure of management-defined performance measures
(as defined) and includes new requirements for the location, aggregation and disaggregation of financial information.
For the purposes of classifying its income and expenses into the categories required by IFRS 18, an entity will need to assess whether it has a ‘main business
activity’ of investing in assets or providing financing to customers, as specific classification requirements will apply to such entities. Determining whether an
entity has such a specified main business activity is a matter of fact and circumstances which requires judgement. An entity may have more than one
IFRS 18 introduces the concept of a management-defined performance measure (MPM) which it defines as a subtotal of income and expenses that an
entity uses in public communications outside financial statements, to communicate management’s view of an aspect of the financial performance of
the entity as a whole to users.
The Group is in the process of assessing the likely impact on the financial statements.
c) IFRS 19 - Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures
In May 2024, the Board issued IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures (IFRS 19), which allows eligible entities to elect to apply
reduced disclosure requirements while still applying the recognition, measurement and presentation requirements in other IFRS accounting standards.
Unless otherwise specified, eligible entities that elect to apply IFRS 19 will not need to apply the disclosure requirements in other IFRS accounting
standards. This standard is effective to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027.
An entity applying IFRS 19 is required to disclose that fact as part of its general IFRS accounting standards compliance statement. IFRS 19 requires an entity
whose financial statements comply with IFRS accounting standards including IFRS 19 to make an explicit and unreserved statement of such compliance.
The Group is in the process of assessing the likely impact on the financial statements.
d) Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture – Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28
The amendments address the conflict between IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures in
dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture.
The amendments clarify that a full gain or loss is recognised when a transfer to an associate or joint venture involves a business as defined in IFRS 3 Business
combinations. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that does not constitute a business, however, is recognised only to the extent
of unrelated investors’ interests in the associate or joint venture.
This standard is effective to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027. The amendments must be applied prospectively. Early
application is permitted and must be disclosed.
e) Power Purchase Agreements - Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7
In December 2024, the Board issued Contracts Referencing Nature-dependent Electricity (Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7).
The amendments include:
- Clarifying the application of the ‘own-use’ requirements
- Permitting hedge accounting if these contracts are used as hedging instruments
- Adding new disclosure requirements to enable investors to understand the effect of these contracts on a company’s financial performance and cash
flows.
The amendments will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2026. Early adoption is permitted, but will need to be
disclosed. This amendment will not have impact on the Group.
3.34 Rounding of amounts
All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million Nigerian Naira (NGN) unless otherwise stated.

reflect the risk of the obligors and the nature of the facility.
In the estimation of credit risk, the Group estimates the following parameters:
- Probability of Default (PD)
- Loss Given Default (LGD)
- Exposure at Default (EAD)

Loss Given Default
LGD isdefined asthe portion of the loan determined to be irrecoverable atthe time of loan default(1 – recovery rate).Our methodsfor
estimating LGD includes both quantitative and qualitative factors which are adjusted for forward looking information to measure lifetime

(vi)General Risk Rating Process
The Group adopts a two-dimensional approach to the assessment of credit risk in the Risk Rating Process for all obligors.
ObligorsareassignedanObligorRiskRating(ORR)whileaFacilityRiskRating(FRRs)isassignedtofacilities.Howevercertainobligors,retailand
commercialloansapplicantsthatdonothaveariskrating,mustaccesscreditthroughproductprogrammeswhilethosethathavecreditratings
can access through the individually assessed credit window. Scoring system is used for consumer loans whereby loans that achieve a
predetermined minimum score are approved.
Inputs used to determine obligor risk ratings (ORRs) are derived based on quantitative and qualitative factors. The quantitative factors are
primarily based on a metrics that uses information on the obligor's financial position while the qualitative factors include:
· Management quality
· Industry risks
· Company profile
· Economic factors

Bucket Scores (Description)
Extremely Low Risk AAA 1.00 - 1.99 90% - 100%
Very Low Risk AA 2.00 – 2.99 80% - 89% Low Risk
Low Risk A 3.00 – 3.99 70% - 79% Range
Acceptable Risk BBB 4.00 – 4.99 60% - 69%

Moderately High Risk BB 5.00 – 5.99 50% - 59% Risk Range
High Risk B 6.00 – 6.99 40% - 49%
High Risk
Very High Risk CCC 7.00 – 7.99 30% - 39% Range
Extremely High Risk CC 8.00 – 8.99 0% - 29%
Unacceptable
High Likelihood of Default C 9.00 – 9.99 Below 0% Risk Range
Default D Above 9.99 Below 0%
The risk ratings are a primary tool in the review and decision making in the credit process. The Group does not lend on unsecured basis to obligors
that are below investment grade (BB and above). The Group will not lend to obligors in the unacceptable risk range.
(viii)Remedial Management Process
ThisprocessismanagedbytheGroupRemedial&RecoveryDivision(GRRD).Dependingontheseverityofclassification,theGroupundertakes
remedial corrective action geared towards ensuring performance of weak credits. Early attention, including substantive discussions with
borrowers, is required to correct deficiencies.
Remedialprocesscoverstheevaluation,analysisorrestructuringofcreditfacilitiesforexistingPDOs.Itmayincludenew extensionsofcredit
and/or restructuring of terms. Some of the possible actions are summarised as follows:
· Rate/Payment modification or longer-term payment relief - adjusting interest rates or payment frequency;
· Ageing/Extension: Modifying the length of the loan;
· Cash Out: Refinancing a loan at a higher principal amount in order to get additional funds for other uses;
· Short Sale – Loan is discounted to prevent imminent foreclosure; and
· Deed in lieu – Voluntary conveyance of interest in property to the Bank
The process calls for full information gathering, together with financial and risk analysis leading up to the approval decision. Analysis and
standardsvaryaccordingtobusinessproduct,market,transactioncharacteristicsandenvironmentalissues.Inallcases,westrivetoachieve

by a variety of financial analytics, combined with processed market information to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk.
All internal risk ratings are tailored to the various categories and are derived in accordance with the Group’s rating policy. The attributable risk ratings are assessed and updated regularly.
The credit quality of the Group's loans and advances are categorized as follows:
Stage 1 Loans and Advances:

ImpairedloansandsecuritiesareloansandsecuritiesforwhichtheGroupdeterminesthatitisprobablethatitwillbeunabletocollectallprincipalandinterestdueaccordingtothe
contractual terms of the loan / securities agreement(s). These are loans and securities specifically impaired.
Loans with renegotiated terms
The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons including changing market conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential
credit deterioration of the customer. The Group renegotiates loans to customers to maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. The revised terms of renegotiated
facilities usually include extended maturity, changing timing of interest payments and amendments to the terms of the loan agreement. As at 30 June 2025, the carrying amount of loans
with renegotiated terms was N114.53 billion (December 2024 : N99.55 billion). There are no other financial assets with renegotiated terms as at 30 June 2025 (December 2024: nil).
Impairment assessment under IFRS
The Group assesses its impairment for the purpose of IFRS reporting using the 'forward-looking' Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model in line with provisions of IFRS 9 - Financial Instrument.

(a) Overview
Marketriskistheriskthatthefairvalueorfuturecashflowsoffinancialinstrumentswillfluctuateduetochangesinmarketvariablessuchasinterestrates,foreign
exchange rates and equity prices. The overall objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters,whileoptimisingthereturnonrisk.TheGroupclassifiesexposurestomarketriskintoeithertradingornon-tradingportfoliosandmanageseachof
theseportfoliosseparately.Thetradingportfolioscomprisepositionsarisingfrommarket-makingandwarehousingofcustomerderivedpositionswhilenon-trading

instruments designated as FVOCI and amortised cost. UBA Group follows the Standardised Approach for market risk regulatory reporting purposes.
(i)Market Risk Management
TheobjectiveofmarketriskmanagementinUBAistoensurethatallsignificantmarketrisksareidentified,measured,andmanagedinaconsistentandeffective
manneracrosstheGroupinordertostabilizeearningsandcapitalandalsotoensurethattheGroupcarriesoutitsaffairswithinacceptableparametersandin
line with the market risk appetite.
Market risk achieves the above stated objective, through a mix of quantitative and statistical controls which covers the under listed activities:
Market data collection and statistical analysis
Limit determination based on market volatility and in-country macro-prudential & regulatory guidelines.
Stop loss limit utilization monitoring
Position monitoring
New trading products risk assessment
P&L attribution analysis
Pricing model validation and sign off
Trading portfolio stress testing
Regulatory limit monitoring
Position data extraction and Internal limit monitoring
Contingency funding plan maintenance and testing
Risk profile reporting to GALCO.
The material risks identified by these measures are summarised in daily reports that are circulated to, and discussed with, senior management.
The universal market risk factors in UBA Group are interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The associated market risks are:
· Foreign currency risk; arising from changes in exchange rates
· Interest rate risk; arising from changes in yield curves and credit spreads
· Equity risk; arising from changes in in the prices of equities, equity indices and equity baskets.
(ii)Market Risk Governance
TheBoard of Directors is responsiblefordeterminingUBAGroup's risk appetite and tolerance limits for all its market risk exposures.Senior management is
responsibleforsupportingtheBoardindeterminingmarketriskappetiteandtolerancelimitsaswellasputtinginplaceallrequisiteprocesses,proceduresand

Management Committee (BRMC) is responsible for the overall governance of market risk as well as defining the terms of reference and delegating responsibilities
toboththeGroupRiskManagementCommittee(GRMC)andGroupAsset&LiabilityManagementCommittee(GALCO).GALCOhasGroupoversightandis

organization, works to ensure that factor sensitivities are calculated and monitored for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios.
(v)Approach to Managing Market Risk in the Non-trading Portfolio
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on UBA’s net interest revenues, the
changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from its investment portfolios and capital invested in foreign currencies.

Group uses a variety of tools to track and manage this risk. These tools include;
• Re-pricing gap analysis
• Liquidity gap analysis
• Earnings-at-Risk (EAR)
• Sensitivity Analysis

5.2 Regulatory capital

The Central Bank of Nigeria setsand monitorscapital requirementsfor the Bank. The parent company and individual banking operationsare
directly supervised by the Central Bank of Nigeria and the respective regulatory authorities in the countries in which the subsidiary banking
operations are domiciled.
The Central Bank of Nigeria requires the Bank to maintain a prescribed ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets.
The Group’s regulatory capital is split into two tiers:

making deductions of goodwill, deferred tax asset and other intangible assets but before deductions of investments.
Banking operationsare categorised mainly astradingbook or banking book,andrisk-weighted assetsare determinedaccordingtospecified
requirements that seek to reflect the varying levels of risk attached to assets and off-balance sheet exposures.

Capital adequacy ratio is the quotient of the capital base of the Bank and the Bank’s risk weighted asset base. UBAPlc operates under an
international banking authorization with a minimum regulatory capital of N50 billion, with a minimum capital requirements of 10.5percent as

6Fair value measurement
Fair values of financial instruments
Thefairvaluesoffinancial assetsandfinancialliabilitiesthataretraded inactive marketsare basedon quotedmarketpricesor dealerprice
quotations. For all other financial instruments, the Group determines fair values using other valuation techniques.
For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective and requires varying degrees of
judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the specific instrument.
88
6.1 Valuation models
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the
measurements.
•Level1:inputsthatarequotedmarketprices(unadjusted)inactivemarketsforidenticalinstruments.Thefairvalueoffinancialinstrumentstraded

instrument is included in level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
• Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments;
• The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves;
•Thefairvalueofforwardforeignexchangecontractsisdeterminedusingforwardexchangeratesatthebalancesheetdate,withtheresulting

When third party information,such asbroker quotesor pricing services,isused to measure fair value,the risk measurementunit assessesand
documents the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of IFRS. This includes:
• Verifying that the broker or pricing service is approved by the Group for use in pricing the relevant type of financial instrument;
• Understanding how the fair value has been arrived at and the extent to which it represents actual market transactions;
•Whenpricesforsimilarinstrumentsareusedtomeasurefairvalue,how thesepriceshavebeenadjustedtoreflectthecharacteristicsofthe

• If a number of quotes for the same financial instrument have been obtained, then how fair value has been determined using those quotes.

Below are the methodologiesand assumptionsused to determine fair valuesfor the above financial instrumentswhich are notrecordedand
measured at fair value in the Group’s financial statements. These fair values were calculated for disclosure purposes only.
i) Cash and bank balances
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
ii) Loans and advances
Loansand advancesare netof chargesfor impairment.To improvethe accuracyof thevaluation estimatefor loans,homogenousloansare
groupedintoportfolioswithsimilarcharacteristics.Theestimatedfairvalueofloansandadvancesrepresentsthediscountedamountofestimated
future cash flows expected to be received. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value.
iii) Investment securities
Thefairvalueisbasedonmarketpricesfromfinancialmarketdealerpricequotations. Wherethisinformationisnotavailable,fairvalueisestimated
using quoted market prices for securities with similar credit, maturity and yield characteristics.
95
iv) Other assets
The bulk of these financial assets have short (less than 3months) maturities and their amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value.
v) Deposits from banks and customers

debts with similar remaining maturity.
vi) Other liabilities
The carrying amount of financial liabilities in other liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
vii) Interest bearing loans and borrowings
The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing borrowings not quoted in an active market is based on discounted cash flows using the contractual
interest rates for these debts over their remaining maturity.

8 Critical accounting estimates and judgments
ThepreparationoftheGroup’sfinancialstatementsrequiresmanagementtomakejudgements,estimatesandassumptionsthat
affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the
disclosure of contingent liabilities.
Uncertaintyabouttheseassumptionsandestimatescouldresultinoutcomesthatrequireamaterialadjustmenttothecarrying

Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to circumstances beyond the Group’s
control and are reflected in the assumptions if and when they occur. Items with the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the financial statements with substantial management judgement and/or estimates are collated below.
These disclosures supplement the commentary on financial risk management (see note 4).
(a) Key sources of estimation uncertainty
(i) Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance
Assets accounted for at amortised cost and FVOCI are evaluated for impairment on a basis described in a.
Themeasurementoftheexpectedcreditloss(ECL)allowanceforfinancialassetsmeasuredatamortisedcostandFVOCIisan
area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit
behaviour(e.g.thelikelihoodofcustomersdefaultingandtheresultinglosses).Detailsoftheinputs,assumptionsandestimation
methodologies used in measuring ECL are described in note 3.27.
A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as:
- Determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk;
- Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL;
-Establishingthenumberandrelativeweightingsofforward-lookingscenariosforeachtypeofproduct/marketandassociated
ECL; and
- Establishing groups of financial assets for the purposes of measuring ECL.
Detailed information about the judgements and estimates made by the Group in the above areas is set out in note 3.27.
The specific counterparty component of the total allowances for impairment applies to financial instruments evaluated
individually for impairment and is based upon management’s best estimate of the present value of the cash flows that are
expected to be received. In estimating these cash flows, management makes judgments about a counter-party’s financial
situationandthenetrealisablevalueofanyunderlyingcollateral.Eachimpairedassetisassessedonitsmerits,andtheworkout
strategy and estimate of cash flows considered recoverable are independently approved by the Credit Risk function.

(b) Critical accounting judgments in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Critical accounting judgments made in applying the Group’s accounting policies include:

(iii) Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill
On an annual basis, the Group carries out impairment assessments of its cash generating units containing goodwill. The
recoverableamountsofthecash-generatingunits(CGU)aredeterminedbasedonvalue-in-usecalculationswhichrequirethe
use of estimates including discount rates and terminal growth rates. Management's estimates of the recoverable amounts of
theseCGU'sissensitivetotheseestimates. Thekeyassumptionsunderlyingtherecoverableamountsaswellassensitivityanalysis
of these key assumptions are disclosed in note 31.
(iv) Determination of exchange rate used for translation
TheGrouptranslatesandrecordsitsforeigncurrencytransactionsandbalancesbasedontheexchangerateatwhichthefuture
cash flows represented by the transactions or balances could have been settled, if those cash flows had occurred at the
reporting date. The Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Fixing (NAFEX) (FMDQ) rate has been used for the translation of
foreign currency balances as this remains the main source of foreign currencies for the Bank's transactions.
(v) Determination of incremental borrowing rate used for discounting lease liabilities
Theincremental borrowingrateisdefinedbyIFRS16astherateofinterestthatalesseewouldhavetopaytoborrow,overa
similartermandwithasimilarsecurity,thefundsnecessarytoobtainanassetofasimilarvaluetothecostoftheright-of-useasset
in a similar economic environment.
The effective borrowing rate used for discounting the future lease payments to present value was determined by using the
corresponding FGN Bond/Bill yields of similar maturity profiles with the outstanding lease terms in addition to the Bank's risk
premiumbasedontheinterestrateoftheBank'squotedsubordinatedseries3notes.Hence,thebankappliedasinglediscount
rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics but matched with their relevant lease terms.
(vi) Hyperinflationary accounting
In 2025, the Group continued to designate Ghana and Sierra Leone as hyperinflationary economies in accordance with IAS 29
and has therefore employed the use of the hyperinflationary accounting to consolidate and report its Ghana and Sierra Leone
operating subsidiaries.
The determination of whether an economy is hyperinflationary requires the Group to make certain estimates and judgements,
such as assessment of historic inflation rates and anticipation of future trends. In addition, the application of hyperinflationary
accounting in accordance with IAS 29 requires the selection and use of price indices to estimate the impact of inflation on the
results of operations and non-monetary assets and liabilities and of the Group.
The selection of price indices is based on the Group’s assessment of various available price indices on the basis of reliability and
relevance. Changes in any such estimates may significantly impact the carrying value of those non-monetary assets or liabilities,
and results of operations, which are subject to hyperinflationary adjustments, and the related gains and losses within the
consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) data covering all items has been obtained from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This measures
the overall change in consumer prices based on a representative basket of goods and services over time as is viewed as
representative of the hyperinflationary economy.
The CPI for Sierra Leone at the beginning of the reporting period was 31.95%, and closed at 28.60%. The CPI for Ghana at the
beginning of the reporting period was 22.4%, and closed at 13.7%.

There were no capitalised borrowing costs related to the internal development of software during the period (December 2024: nil). Computer software has a definite useful life of not
more than five years while goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is annually assessed for impairment.
1 Transfers represents reclassification of items to property and equipment (work in progress) from intangible assets - purchased software (work in progress) during the year as disclosed
in Note 30.
2 Work in progress represents software implementation projects that were currently in their development phase as at reporting date.
( c) Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing Goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) as the goodwill is monitored at the level of the
individual cash generating units. UBA Benin and UBA UK Limited have been identified as individual cash generating units. UBA Benin and UBA UK Limited operate under Rest of Africa
and Rest of the World geographic segments respectively. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been determined based on value-in-use calculations; using cash flow
projections based on financial forecasts covering a period of five years. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated economic growth rates for the
respective CGUs. These growth rates are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports specific to the economic environment in which each of the CGU's operates.
The following table sets out the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations:
UBA Benin UBA UK Limited UBA Zambia
Jun. 2025 Dec. 2024 Jun. 2025 Dec. 2024 Jun. 2025 Dec. 2024
Gross earnings ( % annual growth rate) 20.0 18.0 8.1 10.1 29 2 3
Deposits (% annual growth rate) 10.5 9.5 13.0 9.1 12.0 1 3.5
Loans and advances (% annual growth rate) 11.0 5.0 13.0 14.0 11 5
Operating expenses (% annual growth rate) 8.0 8.0 5.0 6.0 26 2 3
Terminal growth rate (%) 5.0 5.2 1.5 1.5 5 3
Discount rate (pre-tax) (%) 18.0 17.9 9.0 9.5 28.1 3 1
The values assigned to each of the above key assumptions were determined as follows:

In March 2024, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced an increase in the minimum capital requirements for banks, aiming to strengthen the financial sector and position it
to support the real economy. In line with the requirements, international commercial banks are required to maintain a minimum capital of ₦500 billion in share capital and
premium only. Banks were given until March 2026 to comply with the new requirements, with options including raising additional capital, pursuing mergers and acquisitions, or
downgrading their licenses to align with their current capital levels.
The Bank registered an equity capital raise program with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise fresh equity capital of up to ₦400 billion and commenced the first
tranche of the capital raise by a way of Rights Issue in November 2024 and closed by December 24, 2024. The Bank got SEC’s approval of the right share allotment on May 7,
2025, after having received CBN’s approval of the capital verification exercise. The net issue proceeds of ₦234.27 billion following the deduction of the offer costs of ₦5.13 billion
(representing 1.82% of gross issue proceeds) has been recognised in the books.
(b)Share premium
Share premium is the excess paid by shareholders over the nominal value for their shares. Following the completion of first tranche of the equity capital raise program during the
period, a total of N230.849 billion has been recognised in share premium, being the excess paid by shareholders over nominal value for their shares.
(c)Retained earnings
Retained earnings is the carried forward recognised income net of expenses plus current period profit attributable to shareholders less dividend paid during the period.

44 IAS 29 - Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies
The Ghana and Sierra Leone economies were designated as hyperinflationary from 31 December 2023. As a result, application of IAS 29 has been applied to United Bank for
Africa (Ghana) Limited and United Bank for Africa (Sierra Leone) Limited which have a functional currency of Ghanaian cedi and Sierra Leonean leones respectively.
Thus, UBA Ghana Limited and UBA Sierra Leone Limited are operating in a hyperinflationary economy and are required, for group purposes, to report to UBA Plc in its stable
functional currency of Nigerian naira (NGN).
IAS 29 para 37 requires the use of a general price index (GPI) to reflect changes in purchasing power. In our view, the consumer price index (CPI) is the most reliable indicator of
changes in general price level as it is reported at the end of the supply chain and it reflects the impact of prices on the general population’s consumption basket.
The CPI data applied for Ghana and Sierra Leone has been obtained from the IMF website. This has been deemed appropriate as the indices published:
● have a wide range of reference (i.e. the inclusion of most of the goods and services produced in the economy);
● are available for the prior year as well as the current year; and
● have regular monthly updating
(i)Impact on the financial statements of the hyperinflationary subsidiaries

value)
B. Statement of changes in equity
On 1 January 2025 , the components of shareholders’ equity, excluding retained earnings, are restated by applying the GPI from the dates on which the items were contributed
or otherwise arose. Retained earnings are restated for the balancing figure derived from the other amounts in the restated opening statement of financial position.
On 30 June 2025, all components of shareholders’ equity are restated by applying the GPI from the beginning of the period or the date of contribution, if later. The movements for
the period in shareholders’ equity are disclosed in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (“IAS 1”).
C. Statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income
All items in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the current reporting period have been restated by applying the change in the GPI from the dates
when the items of income and expense were originally recorded.
The result of the current period restated comprehensive income is added to the balance of the restated opening retained earnings in the statement of financial position.
Calculation of the monetary gain or loss
The monetary gain or loss is calculated as the difference between:
● the historical amounts; and
● the result from the restatement of non-monetary items, equity and items in the statement of comprehensive income
The monetary gain or loss is reported in the restated statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income and is separately disclosed.
D. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows are reported using Indirect Method. All items in the statement of cash flows are expressed in a measuring unit current at the reporting date. There is no detailed
guidance for the statement of cash flows in IAS 29.

(ii)Impact on the financial statements for the purposes of group reporting
Hyperinflation accounting is applied to all of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities before translation. Restated amounts in the subsidiary’s financial statements (i.e. assets, liabilities,
equity income and expenses) are then translated at the prevailing closing rate
A. Comparative period
For group reporting purposes, the comparatives are not adjusted for subsequent changes in price levels or exchange rates.
B. Elimination of intercompany transactions
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (“IFRS 10”) requires the elimination of intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions
between entities of the group.
Intra-group transactions in a hyperinflationary subsidiaries are restated, however, this could result in a difference between the amounts recognised by the subsidiary and the
parent for the same transaction. This difference is taken into account in the elimination entry.

D. Accounting policy choices
There is no specific guidance in IFRS on where the difference between the restated opening net asset value in the subsidiary's financial statements and the non-restated
comparatives included in the consolidtaed financial statements should be presented in the year an entity first applies IAS 29.
Management has thus elected to treat the combined effects of restating and translating the opening net asset values of the hyperinflationary subsidiaries as a net change in
Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). This is in line with the March 2020 IFRS IC Agenda Decision, which provided management with accounting choices of either treating the
combined effect of restating and translating the opening net assets values as a change in OCI or as a change in equity.
