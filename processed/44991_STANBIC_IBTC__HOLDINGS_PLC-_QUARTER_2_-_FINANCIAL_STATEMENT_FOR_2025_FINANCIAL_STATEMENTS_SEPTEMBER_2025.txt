The board is ultimately responsible for risk management. The main purpose of the risk management committee, as specified in its
mandate is the provision of independent and objective oversight of risk management within the Company. The committee is assisted in

To achieve effective oversight, the committee reviews and assesses the integrity of risk control systems and ensures that risk policies
and strategies are effectively managed and contribute to a culture of discipline and control that reduces the opportunity for fraud.
The risk management committee during the year under review was vested, among others, with the following responsibilities:
- to oversee management’s activities in managing credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and other risks of the Group;
- to periodically review the Group’s risk management systems and report thereon to the board;
- to ensure that the Group’s material business risks are being effectively identified, quantified, monitored and controlled and that the
systems in place to achieve this are operating effectively at all times; and
- such other matters relating to the Group’s risk assets as may be specifically delegated to the committee by the board.
The committee’s mandate is in line with SBG’s standards, while taking account of local circumstances.

Remuneration
Introduction
The purpose of this section is to provide stakeholders with an understanding of the remuneration philosophy and policy applied
across the Group for executive management, employees, and Directors (executive and non-executive).
Remuneration philosophy
TheGroup’sboardandremunerationcommitteesetaremunerationphilosophywhichisguidedbySBG’sphilosophyandpolicyas
well as the specific social, regulatory, legal and economic context of Nigeria.
Inthisregard,theGroupemploysacosttocompanystructure,whereallbenefitsareincludedinthelistedsalaryandappropriately
taxed.
The following key factors have informed the implementation of reward policies and procedures that support the achievement of
business goals:
• the provision of rewards that enable the attraction, retention and motivation of employees and the development of a high
performance culture;
•maintaining competitive remuneration in line with the market, trends and required statutory obligations;
•rewarding people according to their contribution;
•allowing a reasonable degree of flexibility in remuneration processes and choice of benefits by employees;
•utilising a cost-to-company remuneration structure; and
•educating employees on the full employee value proposition.
The Group’s remuneration philosophy aligns with its core values, including growing our people, appropriately remunerating high
performersanddeliveringvaluetoourshareholders.Thephilosophyemphasisesthefundamentalvalueofourpeopleandtheirrole
in ensuring sustainable growth. This approach is crucial in an environment where skills remain scarce.

Thephilosophyaimstomaintainanappropriatebalancebetweenemployeeandshareholderinterests.ThedeliberationsofREMCO
informthephilosophy,takingintoaccountreviewsofperformanceatanumberofabsoluteandrelativelevels–fromabusiness,an
individual and a competitive point of view.
A key success factor for the Group is its ability to attract, retain and motivate the talent it requires to achieve its strategic and
operational objectives. The Group’s remuneration philosophy includes short-term and long-term incentives to support this ability.
Short-term incentives, whichare deliveryspecific, are viewed as strong drivers of competitiveness and performance. Asignificant
portion of top management’s reward is therefore variable, being determined by financial performance and personal contribution
against specific criteria set in advance. This incites the commitment and focus required to achieve targets.
Long-term incentives seek to ensure that the objectives of management and shareholders are broadly aligned over longer time
periods.

Remuneration policy
The Group has always had a clear policy on the remuneration of staff, executive and non-executive Directors which set
such remuneration at levels that are fair and reasonable in a competitive market for the skills, knowledge, experience
required and which complies with all relevant tax laws.
REMCO assists the Group’s board in monitoring the implementation of the Group remuneration policy, which ensures that:
• salary structures and policies, as well as cash and long term incentives, motivate sustained high performance and are
linked to corporate performance objectives;
• stakeholders are able to make a reasonable assessment of reward practices and the governance process; and
• the Group complies with all applicable laws and codes.

Management and general staff
Total remuneration packages for employees comprises the following:
• guaranteed remuneration – based on market value and the role played;
• annual bonus – used to stimulate the achievement of Group objectives;
• long term incentives – rewards the sustainable creation of shareholder value and aligns behaviour to this goal;
• pension – provides a competitive post-retirement benefit in line with other employees.
• where applicable, expatriate benefits in line with other expatriates in Nigeria.
Terms of service

Fixed remuneration
Managerial remuneration is based on a salary and benefit structure. This comprises a fixed cash portion, compulsory
benefits (medical aid and retirement fund membership) and optional benefits. Market data is used to benchmark salary
levels and benefits. Salaries are normally reviewed annually in March.
Forallemployees,performance-relatedpaymentshaveformedanincreasingproportionoftotalremunerationovertimeto
achieve business objectives and reward individual contribution.
All employees (executives, managers and general staff) are rated on the basis of performance and potential and this is
used to influence performance-related remuneration rating and the consequent pay decision is done on an individual basis.
There is therefore a link between rating, measuring individual performance and reward. However, as noted earlier, the
Group's remuneration philosophy is designed in such a way as to prevent excessive risk taking by Management.
Short-term incentives
All staff participate in a performance bonus scheme. Individual awards are based on a combination of business unit

The following principles should be considered when recommending a case for clawback:
● Stanbic IBTC Holdings would like to deal with cases of clawback in a fair and consistent manner across all its operations.
●Beforeclawbackistriggered,areductioninthecurrentyear’sincentiveawardsand/orforfeiturewillbetakenintoaccount.Areductioninthe

●StanbicIBTCHoldingswouldliketogivecertaintytotheindividualsconcernedassoonasreasonablypossiblewithoutcompromisingtheprocess
of a fair investigation and REMCO consideration.
● When determining whether (i) clawback should apply and (ii) the clawback amount, the extent to which the employee had some level of
accountability / responsibility for the trigger event as well as the materiality of the trigger event will be taken into account.
● When determining the clawback amount, REMCO will consider the extent to which the trigger event resulted in the erroneous calculation of the
incentive award.
● Consideration of the matrix and all role players and their accountabilities will be assessed.
●Anindependentinvestigationshouldtakeplacewhenclawbackisbeingconsidered.Inthecourseoftheinvestigationtheemployeewillbegiven
an opportunity to make representations. Recommendations of investigation should be put forward to REMCO.
● In the event that the Company’s audited accounts require a material restatement – REMCO will refer the matter to the Board. The independent
investigation will be conducted by an auditing firm independent of the external auditors who signed off on the relevant accounts in question.
REMCO may refer any serious matter to the Board dependent on materiality and/or seniority of the people concerned.
● Clawback will only be made when all the facts are known, and the independent investigation is concluded.
Should the clawback investigation not be concluded, the three-year clawback period may be extended until the investigation is complete.
Communication to the individual(s) experiencing a delay should indicate that this does not indicate a predetermined outcome but allows for a fair
investigation to be concluded.
● All information relating to the investigation and the outcome with regard to clawback should be documented by the relevant Head of People and
Culture.
The clawback provisions in this section are in alignment with clauses 16.9 and 16.10 of the Nigerian Code of Corporate governance.

Independent auditor’s report
To the Members of Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC
Report on the audit of the interim consolidated and separate financial
statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, the interim consolidated and separate financial statements give a true and fair view of the
consolidated and separate financial position of Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC (“the company”) and its subsidiaries
(together “the group”) as at 30 June 2025, and of their consolidated and separate financial performance and their
consolidated and separate cash flows for the six month period then ended in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim
Financial Reporting’ and the requirements of the Companies and Allied Matters Act and the Financial Reporting
Council of Nigeria (Amendment) Act, 2023.
What we have audited
Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC’s interim consolidated and separate financial statements comprise:
● the consolidated and separate statements of financial position as at 30 June 2025;
● the consolidated and separate statements of profit or loss for the six month period then ended;
● the consolidated and separate statements of comprehensive income for the six month period then ended;
● the consolidated and separate statements of changes in equity for the six month period then ended;
● the consolidated and separate statements of cash flows for the six month period then ended; and
● the notes to the interim consolidated and separate financial statements, which include a summary of
material accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the interim
consolidated and separate financial statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.
Independence
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants (including International Independence Standards), i.e. the IESBA Code issued by the International
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
the IESBA Code.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit
of the interim consolidated and separate financial statements of the current period. These matters were
addressed in the context of our audit of the interim consolidated and separate financial statements as a whole,
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

consolidated and separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.
In preparing the interim consolidated and separate financial statements, the directors are responsible for
assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going

Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the interim consolidated and separate financial
statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the interim consolidated and separate
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these interim consolidated and separate financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the interim consolidated and separate financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control.
● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Group’s internal control.
● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by the directors.
● Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that
may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the interim consolidated and separate financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date
of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a
going concern.
● Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the interim consolidated and separate financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the interim consolidated and separate financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
● Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
units within the Group as a basis for forming an opinion on the interim consolidated and separate financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for
purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that
we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the interim consolidated and separate financial statements of the current
period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine
that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
The Companies and Allied Matters Act requires that in carrying out our audit we consider and report to you on
the following matters. We confirm that:
i) we have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were
necessary for the purposes of our audit;
ii) the company has kept proper books of account, so far as appears from our examination of those books;
iii) the company’s statement of financial position, statement of profit or loss and statement of other
comprehensive income are in agreement with the books of account and returns.

that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Judgements
Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the consolidated annual
financial statements is included in the note below;
• Note 6.9 Depreciation and useful life of property and equipment
• Impairment of financial instruments: assessment of whether credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition (see note 27).
• Assessment of significance of insurance risk: The insurance subsidiary applies its judgement in assessing whether a contract transfers to the issuer significant
insurance risk. A contract transfers significant insurance risk only if an insured event could cause the Company to pay additional amounts that are significant in any
single scenario and only if there is a scenario that has commercial substance in which the issuer has a possibility of a loss on a present value basis upon an
occurrence of the insured event, regardless of whether the insured event is extremely unlikely. The assessment of whether additional amounts payable on the
occurrence of an insured event are significant and whether there is any scenario with commercial substance in which the issuer has a possibility of a loss on a
present value basis involves significant judgement and is performed at initial recognition on a contract-by-contract basis. The type of contracts where this judgement
is required are those that transfer financial and insurance risk and result in the latter being the smaller benefit provided. The application of judgement in this area is
aided by the Company's processes to filter contracts where the additional amounts referred to above are more than 5% but less than 10% of the amounts paid if the
insured event does not occur. Additional amounts that are less than 5% are considered by the Company as insignificant. A specialist unit conducts all these
judgemental classifications under IFRS 17 to maintain consistency across the Company. This assessment is performed after the separation of non-closely related
derivatives, distinct investment components and promises to transfer distinct goods and non-insurance services.
• Classification of financial assets: assessment of the business model within which the assets are held and assessment of whether the contractual terms of the
financial asset are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
• Determination of whether the Group controls investment funds where it act as fund manager (see note 6.8).
• Provision for contingent items such as legal claims, fines, penalties and other tax penalties. (see note 6.7).
• Determination of the fair value of financial instruments with significant unobservable inputs (see note 6.3).
• Recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key assumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources (see notes 27 &
32).
Assumptions and estimation uncertainties
Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment in the period ended 30 June 2025 is
included in the following notes.
• Determination of the fair value of financial instruments with significant unobservable inputs (see note 6.3).
• Determination of the fair value of share-based payments (see note 6.4).
• Impairment of financial instruments: incorporation of forward-looking information in the measurement of ECL.
• Recognition of deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profit against which carry-forward tax losses can be used (see note 16) as well as the likelihood and
uncertainities of the extension of the tax exempt status of income on Government securities which we have assumed to be highly likely. Included in the
recoverability review of deferred tax assets is assumptions about interest rates, exchange rates, inflation rate.
• Assessment of significance of insurance risk: The Company applies its judgement in assessing whether a contract transfers to the issuer significant insurance risk.
A contract transfers significant insurance risk only if an insured event could cause the Company to pay additional amounts that are significant in any single scenario
and only if there is a scenario that has commercial substance in which the issuer has a possibility of a loss on a present value basis upon an occurrence of the
insured event, regardless of whether the insured event is extremely unlikely. The assessment of whether additional amounts payable on the occurrence of an
insured event are significant and whether there is any scenario with commercial substance in which the issuer has a possibility of a loss on a present value basis
involves significant judgement and is performed at initial recognition on a contract-by-contract basis. The type of contracts where this judgement is required are
those that transfer financial and insurance risk and result in the latter being the smaller benefit provided. The application of judgement in this area is aided by the
Company's processes to filter contracts where the additional amounts referred to above are more than 5% but less than 10% of the amounts paid if the insured
event does not occur. Additional amounts that are less than 5% are considered by the Company as insignificant. A specialist unit conducts all these judgemental
classifications under IFRS 17 to maintain consistency across the Company. This assessment is performed after the separation of non-closely related derivatives,
distinct investment components and promises to transfer distinct goods and non-insurance services.

instruments are recognised (derecognised) on the date the Group commits to purchase (sell) the instruments (trade date accounting).
Financial assets

and are inconsistent with a basis lending arrangement, the financial asset is classified as fair value through profit or loss – default.
Fair value through OCI Includes:
• A debt instrument that meets both of the following conditions (other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss):
–– held within a business model in which the debt instrument (financial asset) is managed to both collect contractual cash flows and
sell financial assets; and
–– the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal amount outstanding.
This assessment includes determining the objective of holding the asset and whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a
basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are not considered de minimis
and are inconsistent with a basis lending arrangement, the financial asset is classified as fair value through profit or loss – default.
• Equity financial assets which are not held for trading and are irrevocably elected (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to be
presented at fair value through OCI.
Held for trading Those financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term, those that form part
of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence
of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit taking.
Designated at fair value Financial assets are designated to be measured at fair value in the following instances:
through profit or loss - to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise
- where the financial assets are managed and their performance evaluated and reported on a fair value
Fair value through PL basis
- where the financial asset contains one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the
financial asset’s cash flows.

probability weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, the time value of money and forward looking information.
Stage 1 A 12-month ECL is calculated for financial assets which are neither credit-impaired on origination nor for which there has been
a SICR.
Stage 2 A lifetime ECL allowance is calculated for financial assets that are assessed to have displayed a SICR since origination and
are not considered low credit risk.
Stage 3 A lifetime ECL is calculated for financial assets that are assessed to be credit impaired. The following criteria are used in
determining whether the financial asset is impaired:
• default
• significant financial difficulty of borrower and/or modification
• probability of bankruptcy or financial reorganisation
• disappearance of an active market due to financial difficulties.

The key components of the impairment methodology are described as follows:
Significant increase At eachreportingdatetheGroupassesseswhether thecredit riskof itsexposures hasincreased
in credit risk (SICR) significantlysinceinitialrecognitionbyconsideringthechangeintheriskofdefaultoccurringoverthe
expected life of the financial asset.
Credit risk of exposures which are overdue for more than 30 days are also considered to have
increased significantly.
Low credit risk Exposures are generally considered to have a low credit risk where there is a low risk of default, the
exposure has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations and adverse changes in
economic and business conditions may not necessarily reduce the exposure’s ability to fulfil its
contractual obligations.
Default The Group’s definition of default has been aligned to its internal credit risk management definitions
and approaches. A financial asset is considered to be in default when there is objective evidence of
impairment. The following criteria are used in determining whether there is objective evidence of
impairment for financial assets or Groups of financial assets:
• significant financial difficulty of borrower and/or modification (i.e. known cash flow difficulties
experienced by the borrower)
• a breach of contract, such as default or delinquency in interest and/or principal payments
• disappearance of active market due to financial difficulties
• it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation
• where the Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty,
grants the borrower a concession that the Group would not otherwise consider.
Exposures which are overdue for more than 90 days are also considered to be in default.
Forward-looking Forward looking information is incorporated into the Group’s impairment methodology calculations
information and in the Group’s assessment of SICR. The Group includes all forward looking information which is
reasonable and available without undue cost or effort. The information will typically include expected
macro-economic conditions and factors that are expected to impact portfolios or individual
counterparty exposures.
Write-off Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Financial
assets which are written off may still be subject to enforcement activities.
ECLs are recognised within the statement of financial position as follows:

Reclassification
Reclassifications of financial assets are permitted only in the following instances:
Reclassifications of debt financial assets are permitted when, and only when, the Group changes its business model for managing
financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified. Reclassifications are accounted for prospectively from
the date of reclassification as follows:
• Financial assets that are reclassified from amortised cost to fair value are measured at fair value at the date of reclassification with
any difference in measurement basis being recognised in other gains and losses on financial instruments
• The fair value of a financial asset that is reclassified from fair value to amortised cost becomes the financial asset’s new carrying
value
• Financial assets that are reclassified from amortised cost to fair value through OCI are measured at fair value at the date of
reclassification with any difference in measurement basis being recognised in OCI
• The fair value of a financial asset that is reclassified from fair value through OCI to amortised cost becomes the financial asset’s
new carrying value with the cumulative fair value adjustment recognised in OCI being recognised against the new carrying value
• The carrying value of financial assets that are reclassified from fair value through profit or loss to fair value through OCI remains at
fair value
• The carrying value of financial assets that are reclassified from fair value through OCI to fair value through profit or loss remains at
fair value, with the cumulative fair value adjustment in OCI being recognised in the income statement at the date of reclassification.

Collateral Valuation
To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the group seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collaterals comes in various
forms, such as cash, securities, letter of credit/guarantees, real estate, receivables, inventories, other non-financial assets and
credit enhancements such as netting agreements. Collateral, unless repossessed, is not recorded on the Bank's statement of
financial position.
However, the fair value of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs. It is generally assessed, at a minimum, at inception and re-
assessed on a periodic basis.
To the extent possible, the Bank uses active market data for valuing financial assets held as collaterals. Other financial assets which
do not have readily determinable market values are valued using models. Non-financial collateral, such as real estate, are valued
based on data provided by third parties such as external valuers.

Reassessment Reassessment of lease terms and lease modifications that are not accounted for as a separate lease:

of leases the carrying amount of the lease liability to reflect the payments to be made over the revised term, which are discounted at the applicable rate at the date of reassessment or modification. The carrying amount of lease liability is similarly revised when the variable element of future lease payments
dependent on a rate or index is revised.
For reassessments to the lease terms, an equivalent adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, with the revised carrying amount being depreciated over the revised lease term. However, if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero any further
reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, is recognised in profit or loss.

IFRS 16 - Lessor lease modifications
Finance leases When the Group modifies the terms of a lease resulting in an increase in scope and the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with a stand-alone price for the increase in scope, the Group accounts for these modifications as a separate new lease. These lease
modifications are accounted for as a separate new lease from the effective date of the modification and the net investment in the lease becomes the carrying amount of the underlying asset.
All other lease modifications that are not accounted for as a separate lease are accounted for in terms of IFRS 9, unless the classification of the lease would have been accounted for as an operating lease had the modification been in effect at inception of the lease.
Operating Modifications are accounted for as a new lease from the effective date of the modification.

Prudential disclosure:
6.1 Credit impairment losses on loans and advances
Determination of statutory credit risk reserves
Provisionsundertheprudentialguidelinesaredeterminedusingthetimebasedprovisioningregimeprescribedbythe
Revised Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Prudential Guidelines. This is at variance with the expected loss model
required by IFRS under IFRS 9. As a result of the differences in the methodology/provision regime, there will be
variances in the impairments allowances required under the two methodologies.
Paragraph12.4oftherevisedPrudentialGuidelinesforDepositMoneyBanksinNigeriastipulatesthatBankswould
be required to make provisions for loans as prescribed in the relevant IFRS Standards when IFRS is adopted.
However, Banks would be required to comply with the following:
Impairment allowance for loans recognised in the profit and loss account should be determined based on the
requirements of IFRS. However, the IFRS impairment allowance should be compared with provisions determined
under prudential guidelines and the expected impact/changes in general reserves should be treated as follows:
* Prudential Provisions is greater than IFRS impairment allowance; the excess provision resulting should be
transferred from the general reserve account to a "regulatory risk reserve".
* Prudential Provisions is less than IFRS impairment allowance; IFRS determined provision is charged to the
statement of comprehensive income. The cumulative balance in the regulatory risk reserve is thereafter
reversed to the general reserve account
The company's subsidiary Stanbic IBTC Bank, has complied with the requirements of the guidelines as follows:

Use of assumptions:
6 .2 Expected credit loss on On-balance Sheet and Off-balance sheet exposures
Significant increase in credit risk
ThefollowingareconsideredbytheGroupindeterminingwhethertherehasbeenasignificantincreaseincreditriskonafinancialinstrumentsinceinitial
recognition:
• Change in the probability of default from initial recognition to the reporting date.
• A30-daypastduerebuttal,requiringexposurestobeclassifiedinstage2.Itishowevernotconsideredsufficienttoonlylookatarrearsdatasuchasdays
pastdueinconsideringwhetherthereisasignificantincreaseincreditriskandtheGroupwouldneedtoassessforsignificantincreaseincreditriskthrough
other means. Arrears data are used after exhausting all other methods of determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
• Othermeansofconsideringwhetherthereisasignificantincreaseincreditriskincludestheevaluationofinternalandexternalcreditratingsaswellas
information from external credit bureaus. Information about the economic sector and geographical region of the borrower are also be taken into account.
• WhereasinglecustomerhasmorethanoneloanwiththeGroup(forexample,ahomeloan,revolvingfacility,vehicle andasset finance,etc.), aone
customer view is taken when considering whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. In this instance, a significant increase in the
customer’s credit risk ononeloan account istakeninto account when assessingthe customer’s other loanaccounts. If it isassessed that there isa
significant increase in credit risk in one exposure, then there is a presumption that the customer’s other loans also have a significant increase in credit risk.
• Interms of IFRS9, theGroupisrequired toincorporate bothhistoricalexperience aswellasforward lookinginformation whenassessingwhetheran
instrument’screditriskhasincreasedsignificantlysinceinitialrecognition.Ausefulreferencetoolthatisusedintheassessmentofsignificantincreasein
credit risk is the exposure’s credit rating.
Low credit risk financial instruments
Management assesses whether an instrument would be considered as having a low credit risk. In this regard:
• Ifinternalriskgradingsarebasedonexternalcreditriskratings,allinstrumentswithinthe‘investmentgrade’categorywouldbeconsideredashavingalow
credit risk.
• Ifinternalriskgradingsarenotbasedonexternalcreditriskratings,internalratingsisutilisedinordertodeterminealowcreditriskthreshold.Thethreshold
reflects a low credit risk assumption from a market participant’s perspective taking into account the exposure’s terms and conditions.
Default
The Group has Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) as well as Personal and Private Banking (PPB) and Business and Commercial Banking (BCB)
exposures.DuetothedifferentnatureoffinancialinstrumentsthattheGroupholds,theGroupusesasingledefinitionofdefaultwhichappliestoallfinancial
assets, with implementation guidance for specific circumstances which would meet default in terms of this definition. Default is defined as follows:
• BasedonobjectiveevidencethecounterpartyisunlikelytopayamountspayabletotheGrouponduedateorshortlythereafterwithoutrecoursetoactions
such as realisation of security; or

• the credit risk of the modified instrument at the reporting date based on the modified contractual terms; and
• the credit risk at initial recognition based on the original unmodified contractual terms.
Incorporation of forward-looking information
Forward-looking information
The process to include forward looking information into the expected credit loss impairment model when assessing whether a customer’s credit risk has
increased significantly, involves the following:

Review of the outcome: In this stage the outcome of the model is reviewed by Credit risk management committee (CRMC).

6.3 Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments, such as unlisted equity investments and certain derivatives, that are not
quotedinactivemarketsisdeterminedusingvaluationtechniques.Whereverpossible,modelsuseonlyobservable
market data. Where required, these models incorporate assumptions that are not supported by prices from
observablecurrentmarkettransactionsinthesameinstrumentandarenotbasedonavailableobservablemarket
data. Such assumptions include risk premiums, liquidity discount rates, credit risk, volatilities and correlations.
Changes in these assumptions could affect the reported fair values of financial instruments.
Additional disclosures on fair value measurements of financial instruments are set out in notes 30.
6.4 Share-based payments

and disclosed as computer software intangible assets.
Computer software intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated
impairment losses. The assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The determination of the recoverable amount of each asset

unused tax credits, or deductible temporary differences, can be utilized.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the
related future tax benefit will be realised. The most significant management assumption is the forecasts used to support the

management best estimates will have an impact on the carrying amount of the provisions. Refer to note 27 for further details.
6.8 Investment funds
The Group acts as fund manager to a number of investment funds. Determination of whether the Group controls such an
investment fund usually focuses on the assessment of the aggregate economic interest of the Group in the fund and the
investors'rightstoremovethefundmanager.ForalltheinvestmentfundsmanagedbytheGroup,thetrustdeedempowersthe

Further disclosure in respect of investment funds in which the Group has an interest is contained in note 14.
6.9 Depreciation and useful life of property and equipment
The estimation of the useful lives of assets is based on management’s judgement. Any material adjustment to the estimated
useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on the carrying value of these items.
6.10 Use of estimates and judgements in applying IFRS 17

* Carrying value has been used where it closely approximates fair values. Fair value estimates are made as of a specific point in time based on the characteristics of the financial instruments and relevant

30 Fair values of financial instruments
The fair values of financialassets and financialliabilities that are traded in activemarkets arebased onquoted
market prices or dealer price quotations. For all other financial instruments, fair values are determined using
other valuation techniques.
30.1 Valuation models
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the
inputs used in making the measurements.
Level 1 - fair values are based on quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for an identical
instrument.
Level2-fairvaluesarecalculatedusingvaluationtechniquesbasedonobservableinputs,eitherdirectly(i.e.as
quoted prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from quoted prices). This category includes instruments valued using
quotedmarketpricesinactivemarketsfor similar instruments,quoted pricesfor identicalor similarinstruments
in markets that are considered less than active or other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are
directly or indirectly observable from market data.
Level 3 - fair values are based on valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs. This category
includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the
unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument's valuation. This category includes instruments
that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments where significant unobservable adjustments or
assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.
Valuationtechniquesincludediscountedcashflowmodels,comparisonwithsimilarinstrumentsforwhichmarket
observable prices exist, Black-Scholes and other valuation models. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation
techniques include risk-free and benchmark interest rates, bonds and equity prices, foreign exchange rates,
equity pricess and expected volatilities and correlations.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
- Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments;
- The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows
based on observable yield curves;
- The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the
balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to present value;
- Other techniques,suchasdiscountedcashflowanalysis,areusedtodeterminefair valuefor theremaining
financial instruments.
Fair value estimates obtained from models are adjusted for any other factors, such as liquidity risk or model
uncertainties, to the extent that the Group believes that a third party market participant would take them into
accountinpricingatransaction.For measuringderivativesthat might changeclassificationfrom beinganasset
to a liability or vice versa such as interest rate swaps, fair values take into account the credit valuation
adjustment (CVA) when market participants take this into consideration in pricing the derivatives.

30.2 Valuation framework
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. This framework
includes a market risk function, which has overall responsibility for independently verifying the results of trading
operationsandallsignificantfairvaluemeasurements,andaproductcontrolfunction,whichisindependedntoffront
office management and reports to the Chief Financial Officer. The roles performed by both functions include:
- verification of observable pricing
- re-performance of model valuations;
- review and approval process for new models and changes to models
- calibration and back-testing of models against observed market transactions;
- analysis and investigation of significant daily valuation movements; and
- review of significant unobservable inputs, valuation adjustments and significant changes to the fair value
measurement of level 3 instruments.
Significant valuation issues are reported to the audit committee.

In addition the Bank subsidiary is involved in litigation against AMCON, please refer to note 32.6 for
further details.
32.6 Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) Clawback
The Bank had in December 2012 entered into an agreement with AMCON to purchase the Eligible
Assets (non-performing loan) of a client, which the Bank had classified as “doubtful”. AMCON
confirmed its willingness to purchase the proposed Eligible Assets at a total consideration of about
₦10 billion, which sale/purchase was concluded in December of 2012. As a precondition for the sale,
AMCON unequivocally stated that the pricing of the Eligible Bank Assets was subject to adjustment
within twelve (12) months in line with AMCON guidelines after due diligence on information the Bank
had supplied to AMCON.
AMCON by a letter dated October 4, 2017 informed the Bank of its intention to reprice the loan and
claw back the sum of ₦5.7bn, being what was alleged to be excess overpaid consideration, as a result
of what was felt was an overvaluation. The Bank in its response to the allegation, emphatically denied
the allegations and provided evidence to AMCON to the contrary. The Bank noted that AMCON’s
attempt to reprice the sold Assets, were outside the 12-month claw-back period provided in AMCON’s
guidelines.
Notwithstanding all the clarifications made by the Bank, AMCON proceeded to apply to the Central
Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to debit the Bank’s account with the sum requested to be clawed back, plus
possible accrued interest. Sequel to this, the CBN wrote to Stanbic IBTC on 31 July 2019, informing
the Bank of AMCON’s request to debit the Bank’s account.
Accordingly, the Bank instructed its lawyers to institute a Legal action against AMCON, pursuant to
which it obtained an interim injunction (ex-parte), restraining AMCON and the CBN from debiting its
Account for the alleged claw-back sum. However, the Bank subsequently discovered that AMCON had
earlier filed a suit at the Ferderal High Court, Lagos Division on the same subject matter.
Consequently, the Bank discontinued its suit against AMCON and filed a Counter-Claim against
AMCON in its suit. When the case came up for hearing on 03 July 2024, the counsel for both parties
adopted their respective issues for determination. On 04 July 2025, trial could not proceed as the
Plaintiff's counsel informed the court that their sole witness developed a medical emergency. The
matter was consequently adjourned to 12 November 2025 for commencement of trial. (see note 15).

(b) Deferred bonus scheme (DBS)
It is essential for the Group to retain key skills over the longer term. This is done particularly through share-based
incentive plans. The purpose of these plans is to align the interests of the Group, its subsidiaries and employees, as
well as to attract and retain skilled, competent people.
The Group has implemented a scheme to defer a portion of incentive bonuses over a minimum threshold for key
management and executives. This improves the alignment of shareholder and management interests by creating a
closer linkage between risk and reward, and also facilitates retention of key employees.
All employees,whoareawardedshort-termincentivesoveracertainthreshold,aresubjecttoamandatorydeferralof
a percentage of their cash incentive into theDBS. Vesting of thedeferred bonusoccurs after three years,conditional
on continued employment at that time. The final payment of the deferred bonus is calculated with reference to the
Standard Bank Group share price at payment date. To enhance the retention component of the scheme, additional
increments on the deferred bonus become payable at vesting and one year thereafter. Variables on thresholds and

Deferred bonus scheme 2012 (DBS 2012)
In 2012, changes were made to the DBS to provide for a single global incentive deferral scheme across the Standard Bank Group (SBG). The purpose of the Deferred Bonus
Scheme 2012 is to encourage a longer-term outlook in business decision-making and closer alignment of performance with long-term value creation.
All employees granted an annual performance award over a threshold have part of their award deferred. The award is indexed to the SBG's share price and accrues notional
dividends during the vesting year, which are payable on vesting. The awards vest in three equal amounts at 18 months, 30 months and 42 months from the date of award. The

(d) Performance reward plan (PRP)
A new performance driven share plan commenced in March 2014 which rewards value delivered against specific targets. The PRP incentivises a Group of senior executives to
meet the strategic long-term objectives that deliver value to shareholders, to align the interests of those executives with those of shareholders and to act as an attraction and
retention mechanism in a highly competitive marketplace for skills. The PRP operates alongside the existing conditional, equity-settled long-term plans, namely the EGS, GSIS
and DBS.

Risk appetite
Riskappetiteisanexpressionoftheamount,typeandtenureofriskthattheGroupispreparedtoacceptinordertodeliver
its business objectives.It is the balance of risk and return as the Group implements business plans, whilst recognising a
range of possible outcomes.
The Board establishes the Group’s parameters for risk appetite by:
- providing strategic leadership and guidance;
- reviewing and approving annual budgets and forecasts for the Group and each subsidiary; and
- regularly reviewing and monitoring the Group’s performance in relation to set risk appetite.
The risk appetite is defined by several metrics which are then converted into limits and triggers across the relevant risk
types, at both entity and business line levels, through an analysis of the risks that impact them.
Stress testing
Stress testing serves as a diagnostic and forward looking tool to improve the Group’s understanding of its credit;market,
liquidity and operational risks profile under event based scenarios.
Managementreviews the outcome of stress tests and selects appropriate mitigating actions to minimize and manage the
impact of the risks to the Group.
Residual risk is then evaluated against the risk appetite.
The Group’senterpriserisk managementframeworkis designedto govern,identify,measure,manage,controlandreport
on the principal risks to which the Group is exposed. The principal financial risks are defined as follows:
Credit risk
Credit risk arises primarily in the Group operations where an obligor / counterparty fails to perform in accordance with
agreed terms or where the counterparty’s ability to meet such contractual obligation is impaired.
Credit risk comprises counterparty risk, wrong-way risk, settlement risk, country risk and concentration risk.
Counterparty risk
Counterparty risk is the risk of loss to the Group as a result of failure by a counterparty to meet its financial and/or
contractual obligations to the Group. It has three components:
• primary credit risk which is the exposure at default (EAD) arising from lending and related banking product activities,
including their underwriting;
• pre-settlement credit risk which is the EAD arising from unsettled forward and derivative transactions, arising from the
defaultofthecounterpartytothetransactionandmeasuredasthecostofreplacingthetransactionatcurrentmarketrates;
and
• issuer risk which is the EAD arising from traded credit and equity products, and including their underwriting.
Wrong-way risk
Wrong-way risk is the risk that arises when default risk and credit exposure increase together. There are two types of
wrong-wayriskasfollows:specificwrongwayrisk(whicharisesthroughpoorlystructuredtransactions,forexample,those
collateralized by own or related party shares) and general wrong way risk (which arises where the credit quality of the
counterparty may for non-specific reasons be held to be correlated with a macroeconomic factor which also affects the
credit quality of the counterparty).
Settlement risk

counter value is not received in whole or part.
Country and cross border risk
Country and cross border risk is the risk of loss arising from political or economical conditions or events in a particular
country which reduce the ability of counterparties in that particular country to fulfill their obligations to the Group.
Cross border risks is the risk of restriction on the transfer and convertibilityof local currency funds, into foreign currency
funds thereby limiting payment by offshore counterparties to the Group.

Market risk
Market risk is defined as the risk of a change in the actual or effective market value or earnings of a portfolio of financial
instruments caused by adverse movements in market variables such as equity, bond and commodity prices, foreign
exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, recovery rates, correlations and implied volatilities in the market variables.

Managing interest rate benchmark reform and associated risks
The Group adopted the interest rate benchmarks including the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with
alternative “risk-free” reference rates as part of its IBOR reform program. The Group’s main IBOR exposures as at 31
December 2021 were indexed to the Euro, GBP and USD LIBOR.
The alternative reference rates for Euro LIBOR adopted by the Group is the EURIBOR while the GBP and USD LIBOR
alternative reference rates are the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate
(SOFR) respectively.
Amendments to financial instruments with contractualterms indexed to the EUR and GBP LIBORs were transitioned such

Committee (ARRC). This only applies to certain USD LIBOR tenures such as (o/n, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month).
In accordance with the transition provisions, the amendments have been adopted retrospectively to financial instruments

Principal credit standard and policies
The Group's Governance Standard, as reviewed regularly, sets out the broad overall principles to be applied in credit risk
decisions and sets out the overall framework for the consistent and unified governance, identification, measurement,
management and reporting of credit risk in the Group.
TheCorporateandInvestmentBanking(CIB),BusinessandCommericalBanking(BCB)andPersonalandPrivateBanking
(PPB) GlobalCredit Policies have beendesigned to expand the Group CreditRisk GovernanceStandard requirementsby
embodying the core principles for identifying, measuring, approving, and managing credit risk. These policies provide a
comprehensive framework within which all credit risk emanating from the operations of the bank are legally executed,
properlymonitoredand controlled in orderto minimizethe risk of financialloss;and assure consistencyof approachin the
treatment of regulatory compliance requirements.
In addition to the Credit Risk Governance Standard, CIB, BCB and PPB Global Credit Policies, a number of related credit

Methodology for risk rating
Internalcounterpartyratingsanddefaultestimatesthatareupdatedandenhancedfromtime-to-timeplayanessentialrolein
the credit risk management and decision-making process, credit approvals, internal capital allocation, and corporate
governance functions. Ratings are used for the following purposes:
• Credit assessment and evaluation
• Credit monitoring
• Credit approval and delegated authority
• Economic capital calculation, portfolio and management reporting
• Regulatory capital calculation
• RARORC (Risk-Adjusted Return on Regulatory Capital) calculation
• Pricing: PDs, EADs, and LGDs may be used to assess and compare relative pricing of assets/facilities, in
conjunction with strategic, relationship, market practice and competitive factors.

Methodology for risk rating (continued)
The starting point of all credit risk assessment and evaluation lies in the counterparty risk grading, which is quantified and
calculatedincompliancewiththeGroup’screditratingpolicyandusingsuchBasel-2compliantmodelsasareincurrentuse
and which are updated or enhanced from time to time.
Credit risk quantification for any exposure or portfolio is summarised by the calculation of the expected loss (EL), which is
arrived at in the following way:
• Based on the risk grading foundation which yields the counterparty’s probability of default (PD), the nature and
quantum of the credit facilities are considered;
• A forward-lookingquantificationof the exposure at default (EAD) is determinedin accordancewith Group standard
guidelines.
• Riskmitigantssuchassecurityandassetrecoverypropensitiesarethenquantifiedtomoderateexposureat defaultto
yield the loss given default (LGD).
• Finally, the EL is a function of the PD, the LGD and the EAD.
These parameters are in turn used in quantifying the required regulatory capital reserving, using the Regulatory Capital

In reaching credit decisions and taking credit risk, both the credit and business functions must consistentlyand responsibly

Credit risk measurement
A keyelement in the measurementof credit risk is the assignmentof credit ratings, which are used to determine expected
defaults across asset portfolios and risk bands. The risk ratings attributed to counterparties are based on a combinationof
factors which cover business and financial risks:
The Group uses the PD Master Scale rating concept with a single scale to measure the credit riskiness of all counterparty
types. The grading system is a 25-point scale, with three additional default grades.
Standard &
Group's rating Grade description Poor's Fitch

IFRS 7
The tables that follow analyse the credit quality of loans and advances measured in terms of IFRS 9.
Impairment model
IFRS9requirestherecognitionofexpectedcreditlosses(ECL)ratherthanincurredlossesunderthepreviousIAS39.This
applies to all financial debt instruments held at amortisedcost, fair valuethroughothercommprehensiveincome(FVOCI),
undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantees.
Staging of financial instruments
Financial instruments that are not already credit-impaired are originated into stage 1 and a 12-month expected credit loss
allowance is recognised.
Instruments will remain in stage 1 until they are repaid, unless they experience significant credit deterioration(stage 2) or
they become credit-impaired (stage 3).
Instruments will transfer to stage 2 and a lifetime expected credit loss allowance recognised when there has been a
significant change in the credit risk compared with what was expected at origination.
Instruments are classified as stage 3 when they become credit-impaired.
The framework used to determine a significant increase in credit risk is set out below.

Approach to determining expected credit losses
The accounting policies under IFRS 9 are set out in Note 4.3 Financial instruments. The main methodology principles and
approach adopted by the bank are set out in the following table with cross references to other sections.
For portfolios that follow a standardised regulatory approach, the Group has developed new models where these portfolios
are material.
Incorporation of forward looking information
The determination of expected credit loss includes various assumptions and judgements in respect of forward looking
macroeconomic information.
Significant increase in credit risk (‘SICR’)
Expected credit loss for fi nancial assets will transfer from a 12 month basis to a lifetime basis when there is a signifi cant
increase in credit risk (SICR) relative to that which was expected at the time of origination, or when the asset becomes credit
impaired. On transfer to a lifetime basis, the expected credit loss for those assets will reflect the impact of a default event
expected to occur over the remaining lifetime of the instrument rather than just over the 12 months from the reporting date.
SICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default of an exposure at the reporting date with the risk of default at origination
(after considering the passage of time). ‘Signifi cant’ does not mean statistically signifi cant nor is it refl ective of the extent of
the impact on the Group’s financial statements. Whether a change in the risk of default is signifi cant or not is assessed using
quantitative and qualitative criteria, the weight of which will depend on the type of product and counterparty.
The Group uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative criteria to assess SICR.

IFRS 7 (Continue)
Assessment of credit-impaired financial assets
Credit-impaired financial assets comprise those assets that have experienced an observed credit event and are in default.
Default represents those assets that are at least 90 days past due in respect of principal and interest payments and/or where
the assets are otherwise considered unlikely to pay.
Unlikely to pay factors include objective conditions such as bankruptcy, debt restructuring, fraud or death. It also includes credit-
related modifications of contractual cash flows due to significant financial difficulty (forbearance) where the bank has granted
concessions that it would not ordinarily consider.
Modified financial assets
Where the contractual terms of a financial instrument have been modified, and this does not result in the instrument being
derecognised, a modification gain or loss is recognised in the income statement representing the difference between the original
cash flows and the modified cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The modification gain/loss is directly
applied to the gross carrying amount of the instrument.
If the modification is credit related, such as forbearance or where the Group has granted concessions that it would not ordinarily
consider, then it will be considered credit-impaired. Modifications that are not credit related will be subject to an assessment of
whether the asset’s credit risk has increased significantly since origination by comparing the remaining lifetime probability of
default (PD) based on the modified terms with the remaining lifetime PD based on the original contractual terms.
Transfers between stages
Assets will transfer from stage 3 to stage 2 when they are no longer considered to be credit-impaired. Assets will not be
considered credit-impaired only if the customer makes payments such that they are paid to current in line with the original
contractual terms. In addition:
→ Loans that were subject to forbearance measures must remain current for 12 months before they can be transferred to stage
2;
→ Retail loans that were not subject to forbearance measures must remain current for 180 days before they can be transferred
to stage 2 or stage 1.
Assets may transfer to stage 1 if they are no longer considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk. This will
occur when the original PD based transfer criteria are no longer met (and as long as none of the other transfer criteria apply).
Where assets were transferred using other measures, the assets will only transfer back to stage 1 when the condition that
caused the significant increase in credit risk no longer applies (and as long as none of the other transfer criteria apply).
Governance and application of expert credit judgement in respect of expected credit losses
The determination of expected credit losses requires a significant degree of management judgement which is being assessed
by the Credit Risk Management Committee (CRMC).

liquidity principles as part of a cohesive liquidity management process:
• structural liquidity mismatch management;
• long-term funding ratio;
• maintaining minimum levels of liquid and marketable assets;
• depositor restrictions;
• local currency loan to deposit ratio;
• foreign currency loan to deposit ratio;
• interbank reliance limit;
• intra-day liquidity management;
• collateral management;
• daily cash flow management;
• liquidity stress and scenario testing; and
• funding plans;
• liquidity contingency planning.

The Group ensures that the banking entity (Stanbic IBTC Bank Limited) is within the regulatory liquidity ratio of 30% on a daily basis.

The following criteria apply to readily marketable securities:
• prices must be quoted by a range of counterparties;
• the asset class must be regularly traded;
• the asset may be sold or repurchased in a liquid market, for payment in cash; and
• settlement must be according to a prescribed, rather than a negotiated, timetable.

and settlement systems. At a minimum, the following operational elements are included in the Group’s intra-day liquidity management:
• capacity to measure expected daily gross liquidity inflows and outflows, including anticipated timing where possible;
• capacity to monitor its intra-day liquidity positions, including available credit and collateral;
• sufficient intra-day funding to meet its objectives;
• ability to manage and mobilise collateral as required;
• robust capacity to manage the timing of its intra-day outflows; and
• readiness to deal with unexpected disruptions to its intra-day liquidity flows.

TheGrouprecognisesthat it is not possibleto holdsufficiently largeenoughquantityof readilyavailableliquidityto coverthe
least likely liquidity events. However, as such events can have devastating consequences, it is imperative to bridge the gap
between the liquidity the Group chooses to hold and the maximum liquidity the Group might need.
The Group’s liquidity contingency plan is designed to, as far as possible, protect stakeholder interests and maintain market
confidence in order to ensure a positive outcome in the event of a liquidity crisis. The plan incorporates an extensive early

Market risk
The identification, management, control, measurement and reporting of market risk is categorised as follows:
Trading market risk

Market risk measurement
The techniques used to measure and control market risk include:
• daily foreign currency trading position
• daily VaR;
• back-testing;
• PV01; and
• annual net interest income at risk.

Annual net interest income at risk
A dynamic forward-looking annual net interest income forecast is used to quantify the banks' anticipated interest rate exposure. This
approachinvolves the forecasting of both changingbalancesheet structures and interest rate scenarios,to determinethe effectthese
changes may have on future earnings. The analysis is completed under both normal market conditions as well as stressed market
conditions.
Analysis of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and actual income
The table below highlights the historicaldiversified normalVaR across the various trading desks. The minimum and maximum trading
diversified normal VaR stood at N1,274m and N2,654m respectively with an annual average of N2,095m which translates to a

requirements for banks operating under the framework.
"The Basel II framework is based on three pillars:
• Pillar I - Minimum Capital Requirements. This details various approaches to measure and quantify capital required for the three
major risk components that a bank faces: credit risk, market risk and operational risk. Stanbic IBTC has adopted the Standardized
Approach for Credit and Market Risk and the Basic Indicator Approach for Operational Risk.

retained earnings and reserves created by appropriations of retained earnings. Deferred tax asset, intangible assets and total investment in

Capital Adequacy
The Group’s capital adequacy is measured by both regulatory capital and economic capital. Economic capital measures and
reports all quantifiable risks on a consistent risk-adjusted basis.

Leverage Ratio
This is non-risk based capital measure introduced in the CBN Basel III guidelines to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-
based capital requirements. The leverage ratio is calculated as capital measure divided by exposure measure and is expressed as
a percentage. The capital measure is the Tier I capital of banks while the exposure measure comprises on-balance sheet
exposures, derivatives, securities financing transactions and off-balance sheet exposures. Banks are required to maintain a
minimum leverage ratio of 4% at all times.
