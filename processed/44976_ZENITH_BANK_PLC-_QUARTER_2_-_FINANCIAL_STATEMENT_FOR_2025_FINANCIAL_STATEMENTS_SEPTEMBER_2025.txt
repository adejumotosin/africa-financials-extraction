36 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
1 General information
Zenith Bank Plc (the "Bank") was incorporated in Nigeria under the Companies and Allied Matters Act as a private limited liability company on May 30,
1990. It was granted a banking licence in June 1990, to carry on the business of commercial banking and commenced business on June 16, 1990. The
Bank is domiciled in Nigeria and was converted into a Public Limited Liability Company on May 20, 2004. The Bank’s shares were listed on October 21,
2004 on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. In August 2015, the Bank was admitted into the Premium Board of the Nigerian Stock Exchange.
The registered office adress of the company is Plot 84/87 Ajose Adeogun street, Victoria Island, Lagos.
The principal activity of the Bank is the provision of banking and other financial services to corporate and individual customers. Such services include
granting of loans and advances, corporate finance and money market activities.
The Bank has six subsidiary companies namely; Zenith Bank (Ghana) Limited, Zenith Bank (UK) Limited, Zenith Bank (Sierra Leone) Limited, Zenith Bank
(The Gambia) Limited, Zenith Pensions Custodian Limited and Zenith Nominees Limited. The Bank also has a representative office in China in addition to
operating a branch of Zenith Bank (UK) Limited in the United Arab Emirates and also in France.
The interim consolidated and separate financial statements for the six month period ended 30 June 2025 comprise the Bank and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as "the Group" and individually as "Group entities") and the separate financial statements comprise the Bank. The consolidated and
separate financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2025 were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 24 July 2025. The
directors have the power to amend and re-issue the financial statements.
The Group does not have any unconsolidated structured entity.
2.0 (a) New and amended IFRS Accounting Standards that are effective for the current year
i. Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates titled Lack of Exchangeability
The amendments specify how to assess whether a currency is exchangeable, and how to determine the exchange rate when it is not. The amendments
state that a currency is exchangeable into another currency when an entity is able to obtain the other currency within a time frame that allows for a
normal administrative delay and through a market or exchange mechanism in which an exchange transaction would create enforceable rights and
obligations.
An entity assesses whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency at a measurement date and for a specified purpose. If an entity is able to
obtain no more than an insignificant amount of the other currency at the measurement date for the specified purpose, the currency is not exchangeable
into the other currency.
The assessment of whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency depends on an entity's ability to obtain the other currency and not on its
intention or decision to do so. When a currency is not exchangeable into another currency at a measurement date, an entity is required to estimate the
spot exchange rate at that date. An entity's objective in estimating the spot exchange rate is to reflect the rate at which an orderly exchange transaction
would take place at the measurement date between market participants under prevailing economic conditions.
The amendments do not specify how an entity estimates the spot exchange rate to meet that objective. An entity can use an observable exchange rate
without adjustment or another estimation technique. Examples of an observable exchange rate include:
 a spot exchange rate for a purpose other than that for which an entity assesses exchangeability
 the first exchange rate at which an entity is able to obtain the other currency for the specified purpose after exchangeability of the currency is
restored (first subsequent exchange rate).
An entity using another estimation technique may use any observable exchange rate-including rates from exchange transactions in markets or exchange
mechanisms that do not create enforceable rights and obligations-and adjust that rate, as necessary, to meet the objective as set out above.
When an entity estimates a spot exchange rate because a currency is not exchangeable into another currency, the entity is required to disclose
information that enables users of its financial statements to understand how the currency not being exchangeable into the other currency affects, or is
expected to affect, the entity's financial performance, financial position and cash flows.
The amendments add a new appendix as an integral part of IAS 21. The appendix includes application guidance on the requirements introduced by the
amendments. The amendments also add new Illustrative Examples accompanying IAS 21, which illustrate how an entity might apply some of the
requirements in hypothetical situations based on the limited facts presented.
In addition, the IASB made consequential amendments to IFRS 1 to align with and refer to the revised IAS 21 for assessing exchangeability. The
amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025, with earlier application permitted.
These new requirements will apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.
37 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
This amendment did not have a significant impact on the Group consolidated financial statements.
(b) New IFRS Accounting Standards in issue but not yet effective
The following standard had been issued but are not yet effective for period ended on 30 June 2025. The Group has not early adopted the underlisted
standard in preparing the financial statements as it plans to adopt it at the effective date, if applicable.
i. IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements
IFRS 18 replaces IAS 1, carrying forward many of the requirements in IAS 1 unchanged and complementing them with new requirements. In addition,
some IAS 1 paragraphs have been moved to IAS 8 and IFRS 7. Furthermore, the IASB has made minor amendments to IAS 7 and IAS 33 Earnings per
Share.
IFRS 18 introduces new requirements to:
 present specified categories and defined subtotals in the statement of profit or loss
 provide disclosures on management-defined performance measures (MPMs) in the notes to the financial statements
 improve aggregation and disaggregation.
The key new concepts introduced in IFRS 18 relate to: the structure of the statement of profit or loss with defined subtotals; requirement to determine
the most useful structure summary for presenting expenses in the statement of profit or loss required disclosures in a single note within the financial
statements for certain profit or loss performance measures that are reported outside an entity’s financial statements (that is, management-defined
performance measures); and enhanced principles on aggregation and disaggregation which apply to the primary financial statements and notes in
general.
An entity is required to apply IFRS 18 for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027, with earlier application permitted. The
amendments to IAS 7 and IAS 33, as well as the revised IAS 8 and IFRS 7, become effective when an entity applies IFRS 18. IFRS 18 requires retrospective
application with specific transition provisions.
The impact of this Standard on the Group's financial statement is currently under assessment.
The directors of the company anticipate that the application of these amendments may have an impact on the group's consolidated financial statements
in future periods.

ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
(c) Material accounting policies
Except as noted in Note 2.0(a), the Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in these consolidated and
separate financial statements, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
(a). Statement of compliance
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standrds (IAS 34) Interim Financial Reporting and in the manner
required by the Companies and Allied Matters Act of Nigeria 2020, the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria (Amendment) Act 2023, the Banks and
other Financial Institutions Act of Nigeria, and relevant Central Bank of Nigeria circulars. The financial statements comply with the International Financial
Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) (IFRS Accounting Standards).
(b) Basis of measurement
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of the following:
 Derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value; and
 Non-derivative financial instruments, carried at fair value through profit or loss, or fair value through other comprehensive income which are
measured at fair value.
(c) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS Accounting standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of
judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated and separate financial statements are disclosed in
Note 4.
2.2 Basis of Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity if it is exposed to, or has the rights to variable returns from its involvement
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The Group reassesses whether it has control if there are
changes to one or more elements of control. This includes circumstances in which protective rights held become substantive and lead to the Group
having control over an investee.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the Group acquires control, up to the date that such effective control ceases.
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions (transactions with owners).
When the proportion of the equity held by Non Controlling Interests (NCIs) changes, the carrying amounts of the controlling and NCIs are adjusted to
reflect the changes in their relative interests in the Subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and
the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the Group.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between companies within the Group are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated in the same manner as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Accounting
policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
In the separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
(b) Loss of Control
On loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any related non-controlling interests and the other components of
equity relating to a subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss. If the Group retains any interest in the
previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, that retained interest is accounted for as
an equity-accounted investee or as a financial asset depending on the level of influence retained.
(c) Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and
50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The
Group's investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss.
39 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
2.2 Basis of Consolidation (continued)
The Group's share of its associates' post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition movements in
reserves are recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the
Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates. Unrealised
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have
been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
(d) Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets at the acquisition date. Changes in the
Group's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
2.3 Translation of foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions and balances
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the entity operates (functional currency). The parent entity’s functional currency (Nigerian Naira) is adopted as the presentation currency for the
separate and consolidated financial statements. Except as otherwise indicated, financial information presented in Naira has been rounded to the nearest
million.
(b) Group companies
Except for those subsidiaries operating in a hyper-inflationary economy (as shown in note 2.27), the results and financial position of all the Group entities
that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
i) assets and liabilities for statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date;
ii) income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates (unless
this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income
and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented within equity as foreign currency translation
reserves.
On the disposal of a foreign operation, the Group recognises in profit or loss the cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to that foreign
operation. When a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, the Group re-attributes the proportionate share of the
cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income to the non-controlling interests in that foreign operation. In
the case of any other partial disposal of a foreign operation, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss only the proportionate share of the cumulative
amount of exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at
the closing rate at the reporting date.
(c) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation
where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at historical cost are translated to the functional currency using
the exchange rate at the transaction date, and those measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date
that the fair value was determined and are recognised in the profit or loss. When a gain or loss on non-monetary item is recognised in other
comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss shall be recognised in other comprehensive income. Conversely, when a gain or
loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in profit or loss, any exchange of that gain or loss shall be recognised in profit or loss.
Translation differences on equities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are included in other comprehensive income and
transferred to the fair value reserve in equity.
40 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
2.3 Translation of foreign currencies (continued)
Foreign currency gains and losses on intra-group loans are recognised in profit or loss unless settlement of the loan is neither planned nor likely to occur
in the foreseeable future, in which case the foreign currency gains and losses are initially recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in the
consolidated financial statements. Those gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss at the earlier of settling the loan or at the time at which the
foreign operation is disposed.
2.4 Cash and cash equivalents
In the statement of financial position, cash and balances with central bank comprises cash on hand and balances with central bank.
For the purposes of the statement of cash flow, cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with original maturities of three (3) months or less than
three months from the date of acquisition that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Group in the
management of its short-term commitments. They include cash and non-restricted balances with central banks, treasury bills and other eligible bills,
amounts due from other banks and short-term government securities.
2.5 Financial instruments
(a)Initial recognition and measurement
Financial instruments are recognised initially when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value with transaction costs, which are directly attributable
to the acquisition or issue of the financial instruments, being recognised immediately through profit or loss. Financial instruments that are not carried at
fair value through profit or loss are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the
financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised or de-recognised on the date the Group settles the purchase or sale of the instruments (settlement date
accounting).
(b)Subsequent measurement
Subsequent to initial measurement, financial instruments are measured either at amortised cost or fair value depending on their classification category.
(c)Classification
(i) Financial assets
Subsequent to initial recognition, all financial assets within the Group are measured at:
 Amortised cost;
 Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); or
 Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
The Group's financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following criteria and are not designated as at FVTPL:
 'Hold to collect' business model test - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the financial asset in other to collect
contractual cash flows; and
 'SPPI' contractual cash flow characteristics test - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding on a specified date. Interest in this context is the consideration for the time
value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time.
Debt instruments are measured at amortised cost by the Group if they meet both of the following criteria and are not designated as at FVTPL:
 'Hold to collect and sell' business model test: The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both holding the
financial asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and selling the financial asset; and
 'SPPI' contractual cash flow characteristics test: The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
All other financial assets including equity investments are measured at fair value.
41 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
2.5 Financial instruments (continued)
A financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) by the Group if the financial asset is:
 A debt instrument that does not qualify to be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI;
 An equity investment which the Group has not irrevocably elected to classify as at FVOCI and present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI;
 A financial asset where the Group has elected to measure the asset at FVTPL under the fair value option.
(ii) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are either classified by the Group as:
 Financial liabilities at amortised cost; or
 Financial liabilities as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost by the Group unless either:
 The financial liability is held for trading and is therefore required to be measured at FVTPL, or
 The Group elects to measure the financial liability at FVTPL (using the fair value option).
(iii) Financial guarantees contracts and loan commitments
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the Group (issuer) to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs
because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.
Loan commitments are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions. Financial guarantees issued or commitments to
provide a loan at a below-market interest rate are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the loss allowance
determined in accordance with IFRS 9 (see note 3.2.18) and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income
recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.
The Group has issued no loan commitments that are measured at FVTPL.
Liabilities arising from financial guarantees and loan commitments are included within provisions.
The Group conducts business involving commitments to customers. The majority of these facilities are set-off by corresponding obligations of third
parties. Contingent liabilities and commitments comprise usance lines and letters of credit.
Usance and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer in the future subject to certain conditions. An acceptance is an undertaking by a bank
to pay a bill of exchange drawn on a customer.
Letters of credit are given as security to support the performance of a customer to third parties. As the Group will only be required to meet these
obligations in the event of the Customer’s default, the cash requirements of these instruments are expected to be considerably higher than their nominal
amounts.
Contingent liabilities and commitments are initially recognized at fair value which is also generally equal to the fees received and amortized over the life
of the commitment. The carrying amount of contingent liabilities are subsequently measured at the higher of the present value of any expected payment
when a payment under the contingent liability has become probable and the unamortised fee.
Business model assessment
The Group assesses the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is
managed, and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:
- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses
on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the
liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
– how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group’s management;
– the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and its strategy for how those
risks are managed;

– how managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash
flows collected); and
– the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However,
information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group’s stated objective for managing the
financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.
Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are
neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.
Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as
consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and
for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether
the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this
condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers:
– contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
– terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and features that modify consideration of the time
value of money (e.g. periodical reset of Interest rate).
The Group holds a portfolio of long-term fixed-rate loans for which the Group has the option to propose to revise the interest rate at periodic reset
dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem
the loan at par without penalty. The Group has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loans are SPPI because the option varies the interest
rate in a way that is consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and costs associated with the principal amount
outstanding.
Reclassifications
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group changes its business model for managing
financial assets.
(d) Derecognition
(i) Financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire (see also (e)), or it transfers the
rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are
transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the
financial asset.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the
asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any
cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit or loss.
Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on
derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is
recognised as a separate asset or liability.
The Group sometimes enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its statement of financial position, but retains either all or
substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.
Examples of such transactions are securities lending and sale-and-repurchase transactions.
When assets are sold to a third party with a concurrent total rate of return swap on the transferred assets, the transaction is accounted for as a secured
financing transaction similar to sale-and-repurchase transactions, because the Group retains all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership
of such assets.

for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
2.5 Financial instruments (continued)
In transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains
control over the asset, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is
exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.
In certain transactions, the Group retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee. The transferred asset is derecognised if it
meets the derecognition criteria. An asset or liability is recognised for the servicing contract if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less
than adequate (liability) for performing the servicing.
(ii) Financial liabilities
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.
(e) Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets
If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different.
If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this
case, the original financial asset is derecognized (see (d)) and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees
received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows: - fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that
represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and - other fees are included in profit or loss
as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.
If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximize recovery of the
original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Group plans to modify a financial asset in a way
that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes
place (see below for write off policy). This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not
usually met in such cases.
If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Group first
recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment
as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. For floating-rate financial assets, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain
or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs or fees incurred and fees received as part of the modification
adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.
If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower (see (2.9)), then the gain or loss is presented together with
impairment losses for stage 1 facilities. For stage 2 and 3, the modification gain or loss is disclosed separately. In other cases, it is presented as interest
income calculated using the effective interest rate method.
Financial liabilities
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this
case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability
derecognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the
assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.
If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the
modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. For floating-rate financial liabilities,
the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the
modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term
of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.
(f) Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group
currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS Accounting standards, or for gains and losses arising from a group of
similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading activity.

ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
2.5 Financial instruments (continued)
(g)Amortised cost measurement
The amortised cost of a financial asset or liability is the amount at which the financial asset or liability is measured at initial recognition, minus principal
repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest rate method of any difference between the initial amount recognised
and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for impairment.
(h)Fair value measurement
‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a
liability reflects its non-performance risk.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or
received. However, in some cases the initial estimate of fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition may be different from its transaction
price. If this estimated fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (without
modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, then the difference is
recognised in profit or loss on initial recognition of the instrument. In other cases, the fair value at initial recognition is considered to be the transaction
price and the difference is not recognised in profit or loss immediately but is recognised over the life of the instrument on an appropriate basis or when
the instrument is redeemed, transferred or sold, or the fair value becomes observable.
If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the Group measures assets and long positions at a bid price and
liabilities and short positions at an ask price. Where the Bank has positions with offsetting risks, mid market prices are used to measure the offsetting risk
positions and a bid or ask price adjustment is applied only to the net open position as appropriate.
The fair value of a demand deposit is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date on which the amount could be
required to be paid.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the fair value of a financial instrument is based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotation for financial
instruments. If a market for a financial instrument is not active, then the Group establishes fair value using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques
include using recent arm's length transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties (if available), reference to the current fair value of other
instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analyses and option pricing models. The chosen valuation technique makes maximum
use of market inputs, relies as little as possible on estimates specific to the Group, incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in
setting a price, and is consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments. Inputs into valuation techniques reasonably
represent market expectations and measures of the risk-return factors inherent in the financial instrument.
See note 3.5 on fair valuation methods and assumptions.
(i)Assets pledged as collateral
Financial assets transferred to external parties and which do not qualify for de-recognition are reclassified in the statement of financial position from
treasury bills and investment securities to assets pledged as collateral, if the transferee has received the right to sell or re-pledge them in the event of
default from agreed terms. Assets pledged as collateral are initially recognised at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair
value as appropriate. These transactions are performed in accordance with the usual terms of securities lending and borrowing.
(j)Assets under repurchase agreement
Assets under repurchase agreement are transactions in which the Group sells a security and simultaneously agrees to repurchase it (or an asset that is
substantially the same as the one sold) at a fixed price on a future date. The Group continues to recognise the securities in their entirety in the statement
of financial position because it retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. The cash consideration received is recognised as a financial
asset and a financial liability is recognised for the obligation to pay the repurchase price. Because the Group sells the contractual rights to the cash flows
of the securities, it does not have the ability to use the transferred assets during the term of the arrangement.
2.6 Derivative instruments
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair
value. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.
The method of recognizing the resulting fair value gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies as a hedging instrument,
and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as Hedges of the fair value of recognized assets or liabilities or
firm commitments (fair value hedges).
The Group documents, at the inception of the hedge, the relationship between hedged items and hedging instruments, as well as its risk management
45 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing
basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged
items.
(a) Fair Value Hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the statement of profit or loss, together with
changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The Bank discontinues hedge accounting in any of the following circumstances:
• The hedging instrument is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge
• The hedging instrument has expired, is sold, terminated, or exercised
• The hedged item matures, is sold, or repaid
• The forecast transaction is no longer deemed highly probable
• The Bank elects to discontinue hedge accounting voluntarily
Derivatives that do not qualify for Hedge Accounting
Certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative not designated in a hedging relationship are
recognized immediately in profit or loss and are included in Trading gains/(losses).
2.7 Impairment
The Group recognises loss allowances for ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL:
• Financial assets that are debt instruments;
• Lease receivables;
• Financial guarantee contracts issued; and
• Loan commitments issued.
No impairment loss is recognised on equity investments.
The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the following, for which they are measured as 12-month ECL:
• Debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and
• Other financial instruments on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition.
12-month ECL are the portion of ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting
date. Financial instrument for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as 'stage 1 financial instruments'.
Life-time ECL are the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument. Financial instruments for which a
lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired are referred to as ‘Stage 2 financial instruments’.
Financial instruments for which lifetime ECL is recognised which are credit impaired are referred to as 'Stage 3 financial instruments".
Loss allowances for other assets and lease receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.
The Group considers debt investment securities to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood definition of
‘investment grade’.
2.7.1 Measurement of ECL
ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:
• Financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows
due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive);
• Financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated
future cash flows;
46 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
2.7 Impairment (continued)
• Undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Group if the commitment is
drawn down and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive; and
• Financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amount that the Group expects to recover.
• There has been no change in estimation techniques from prior period. Also, significant assumptions made during the period can be seen in note 4.2.
Reversal of Impairment and Backward Transfer Criteria
When the Group has measured the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to lifetime ECL in the previous reporting period but
determines at the current reporting date that criteria for recognizing the lifetime ECL is no longer met i.e. cured, the Group measures the loss allowance
at an amount equal to 12-month ECL at the current reporting date.
However, the Group observes the following backward transfer criteria (probationary period) to monitor if the criteria for recognizing the lifetime ECL has
decreased significantly before the backward transfer can be effected on the credit rating of the customer;
90 days probationary period to move a financial instrument from Lifetime ECL not credit-impaired (Stage 2 financial instruments) to 12 months ECL
(Stage 1 financial instruments);
90 days probationary period to move a financial instrument from Lifetime ECL credit-impaired (Stage 3 financial instruments) to Lifetime ECL not
impaired (Stage 2 financial instruments);
180 days probationary period to move a loan from Lifetime ECL credit-impaired (Stage 3 financial instruments) to 12 months ECL (Stage 1 financial
instruments).
The Group also considers other qualitative criteria where necessary.
Impairment gains arising from backward transfers will be recognized as part of ‘impairment losses on financial instruments.’
2.7.2 Credit-impaired financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit-impaired referred to as 'Stage 3 financial
instruments. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the
financial asset have occurred.
Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:
• Significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
• A breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
• The restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;
• It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
• The disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.
A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence
that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a loan that is
overdue for 90 days or more is considered impaired.
In making an assessment of whether an investment in sovereign debt is credit-impaired, the Group considers the following factors.
• The market’s assessment of creditworthiness as reflected in the bond yields.
• The rating agencies’ assessments of creditworthiness.
• The country’s ability to access the capital markets for new debt issuance.
• The probability of debt being restructured, resulting in holders suffering losses through voluntary or mandatory debt forgiveness.
47 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
2.7 Impairment (continued)
• The international support mechanisms in place to provide the necessary support as ‘lender of last resort’ to that country, as well as the intention,
reflected in public statements, of governments and agencies to use those mechanisms. This includes an assessment of the depth of those mechanisms
and, irrespective of the political intent, whether there is the capacity to fulfil the required criteria.
2.7.3 Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of financial position
Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the statement of financial position as follows:
• Financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets;
• Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision;
• Where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Group cannot identify the ECL on the loan commitment
component separately from those on the drawn component: the Group presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined
amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of
the drawn component is presented as a provision and;
• Debt instruments measured at FVOCI, no loss allowance is recognised in the statement of financial position because the carrying amount of the asset is
their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and recognised in the fair value reserve.
2.7.4 Write-off policy
The Group writes off a loan balance when the Group’s credit department determines that the loan is uncollectable and had been declared delinquent
and subsequently classified as lost. This determination is made after considering information such as the continuous deterioration in the customer’s
financial position, such that the customer can no longer pay the obligation, or that proceeds from the collateral will not be sufficient to pay back the
entire exposure. Board approval is required for such write-off. For insider-related loan (loans by the Bank to its own officers and directors), CBN approval
is required. The loan recovery department continues with its recovery efforts and any loan subsequently recovered is treated as other income.
Loans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the
Group determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject
to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s
procedures for recovery of amounts due.
The outstanding contractual amounts of assets written off during the period ended 30 June 2025 was N1.18 trillion (31 December 2024: N94.4 billion).
The Group still seeks to recover amounts it is legally owed in full, but which have been written off due to no reasonable expectation of full recovery.
2.8 Reclassification of financial instruments
Financial assets are required to be reclassified in certain rare circumstances among the amortised cost, FVOCI and FVTPL categories. When the Group
changes its business model for managing financial assets, the Group reclassifies all affected financial assets in accordance with the new model. The
reclassification is applied prospectively from the reclassification date. Accordingly, any previously recognised gains, losses or interest are not reinstated.
Changes in the business model for managing financial assets are expected to be very infrequent.
2.9 Restructuring of financial instruments
Financial instruments are restructured when the contractual terms are renegotiated or modified or when an existing financial instrument is replaced
with a new one due to financial diffculties of the borrower. Restructured loans represent loans whose repayment periods have been extended due to
changes in the business dynamics of the borrowers. For such loans, the borrowers are expected to pay the principal amounts in full within extended
repayment period and all interest, including interest for the original and extended terms.
2.10 Collateral
The Group obtains collateral where appropriate, from customers to manage their credit risk exposure to the customers. The collateral normally takes the
form of a lien over the customer’s assets and gives the Group a claim on these assets for customers in the event that the customer defaults.
The Group may also use other credit instruments, such as derivative contracts in order to reduce their credit risk.
Collateral received in the form of securities and other non-cash assets is not recorded on the statement of financial position. Collateral received in the
form of cash is recorded on the statement of financial position with a corresponding liability see note 3.2.7(a)(i)
48 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
In certain cirumstances, property may be repossessed following the foreclosure on loans that are in default. These repossessd collateral are sold as soon
as practicable. Repossessed properties are measured at the lower of carrying amount of the related loan and fair value less cost to sell and reported
within 'Other asset'.
2.11 Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Where significant parts of an item of property and equipment have different
useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance
are charged to profit or loss during the financial year in which they are incurred.
Property and equipment are depreciated on the straight line basis to their residual values over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Land is not
depreciated.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to write down the cost of property and equipment to their residual values over their estimated useful
lives as follows:
Item
Land Not depreciated
Motor vehicles 4 years
Office equipment 5 years
Furniture, fittings and equipment 5 years
Computer equipment 3 years
Buildings 50 years
Leasehold improvement Over the remaining lease period
Aircraft 25 years
Right of use assets: Buildings Lower of lease term or the useful life for the specified class of
item
Depreciation is included in profit or loss.
Work in progress consists of items of property and equipment that are not yet available for use. Work in progress is carried at cost less any required
impairment. Depreciation starts when assets are available for use. An impairment loss is recognised if the asset’s recoverable amount is less than cost.
The asset is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once the
items are available for use, they are transferred to relevant classes of property and equipment as appropriate.
Property and equipment are derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or disposal.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in profit or loss.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset is capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. Other
costs relating to borrowings which the group undertakes in the normal course of business are expensed in the period which they are incurred.
2.12 Intangible assets
Computer software
Software that is not integral to the related hardware acquired by the Group is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised expenses as they are incurred. Development costs that are directly
attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, are recognised as intangible assets when the
following criteria are met:
i) it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
49 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
ii) management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;
iii) there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
iv) it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits
v) adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use/sell the software product are available
vi) the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Subsequent expenditure on computer software is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it
relates.
Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, from the date that the asset is available for
use since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. The estimated useful life for
computer software is 5 years.
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial period-end and adjusted if appropriate.
Intangible assets are derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or disposal.
2.13 Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether
there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each period at the same time.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its Cash Generating Unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset or CGU. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of
assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or CGU.
The Group's corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a
reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs) and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An
impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only
to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or
amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
2.14 Leases
A. Group / Bank as a lessee
Leases, under which the Bank possess a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
consideration is disclosed in the Bank's statement of financial position and recognized as a leased asset.
The major lease transaction wherein the Group/Bank is lessee relates to the lease of Bank's branches
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time, the Bank assesses whether, throughout the
period of use, it has both of the following:
(a) the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset, and
(b) the right to direct the use of the identified asset.
The Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for some leases of low value assets. The Group recognizes expenses
associated with these leases as an expense on straight line basis over the lease term.
Payments associated with short term leases are recognised on a straight line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short term leases are leases with a
lease term of 12 months or less without a purchase option.
The Group presents right-of-use assets as a separate class under ‘property and equipment’. The Group presents lease liability in other liabilities in the
statement of financial position.

2.14 Leases (continued)
The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, and
subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its
incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.
The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payment made. It is remeasured when there
is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a
residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised
or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The Group has applied judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The
assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease
liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized.
C. Group / Bank as a lessor
Lease and instalment sale contracts are primarily financing transactions in banking activities, with rentals and instalments receivable, less unearned
finance charges, being included in Loans and advances to customers in the statement of financial position. Finance charges earned are computed using
the effective interest method which reflects a constant periodic return on the investment in the finance lease. Initial direct costs paid are capitalized to
the value of the lease amount receivable and accounted for over the lease term as an adjustment to the effective interest rate method.
The Group recognizes assets held under a finance lease in its statement of financial position and present them as a receivable at an amount equal to the
net investment in the lease. Initially, the Group will recognize a finance lease receivable at the amount equal to the net investment in the lease.
Subsequently, finance income will be recognized at a constant rate on the net investment. During any ‘payment free’ period, this will result in the
accrued finance income increasing the finance lease receivable.
For finance leases, the lease payments included in the measurement of the net investment in a lease at commencement date includes variable lease
payments that depend on an index or a rate; other variable payments (e.g. those linked to future performance or use of an underlying asset) are
excluded from the measurement of the net investment and are instead recognized as income when they arise. The treatment adopted for variable lease
payments under operating leases are consistent with these requirements.
2.15 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed formal plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has
been announced publicly. Future operating costs or losses are not provided for. A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected
benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is
measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.
Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or non-occurrence,
of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Group’s control. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are
disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
The Group recognises liability for a levy not earlier than when the activity that triggers payment occurs. Also, the Group accrues liability on levy
progressively only if the activity that triggers payment occurs over a period of time. However, for a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum
threshold, no liability is recognised before the specified minimum threshold is reached.
2.16 Employee benefits
(a) Post-employment benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution plan.
51 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
2.16 Employee benefits (continued)
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or
constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee
service in the current and prior periods. For defined contribution plans, the Group makes contributions on behalf of qualifying employees to a mandatory
scheme under the provisions of the Pension Reform Act. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The
contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash
refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. For entities operating in Nigeria, the contribution by employees and the employing entities are
8% and 10% respectively of the employees' basic salary, housing and transport allowances. Entities operating outside Nigeria contribute in line with the
relevant pension laws in their jurisdictions.
(b) Short-term benefits
Short-term benefits consist of salaries, accumulated leave allowances, profit share, bonuses and any non-monetary benefits.
Short-term employee benefits are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related services are provided. They are included in
personnel expenses in the profit or loss.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash benefits such as accumulated leave and leave allowances if the Group
has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past services provided by the employee and the obligation can be
measured reliably.
(c) Termination benefits
The Group recognises termination benefits as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a
formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made
to encourage voluntary redundancy. The Group settles termination benefits within twelve months and are accounted for as short-term benefits.
2.17 Share capital and reserves
(a) Share issue costs
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of
tax, from the proceeds.
(b) Dividends on ordinary shares
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are approved by the Bank’s shareholders. Dividends for the year that
are declared after the end of the reporting period are dealt with in the subsequent events note.
(c) Share premium
Premiums from the issue of shares are reported in share premium.
(d) Statutory reserve
Nigerian banking regulations require the Bank to make an annual appropriation to a statutory reserve. As stipulated by The Banks and Other Financial
Institutions Act (BOFIA) 2020, an appropriation of 30% of profit after tax is made if the statutory reserve is less than the paid-up share capital and 15% of
profit after tax if the statutory reserve is greater than the paid-up share capital.
(e) SMIEIS reserve
The SMIEIS reserve is maintained to comply with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) requirement that all licensed banks set aside a portion of the profit
after tax in a fund to be used to finance equity investments in qualifying small and medium scale enterprises. Under the terms of the guideline (amended
by CBN letter dated 11 July 2006), the contributions will be 10% of profit after tax and shall continue after the first 5 years but banks’ contributions shall
thereafter reduce to 5% of profit after tax. The small and medium scale industries equity investment scheme reserves are nondistributable. Transfer to
this reserve is no longer mandatory.
(f) Statutory reserve for credit risk
The Nigerian banking regulator requires the Bank to create a reserve for the difference between impairment provision determined in line with the
principles of IFRS Accounting standards and impairment provision determined in line with the prudential guidelines issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN). This reserve is not available for distribution to shareholders.

Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
2.17 Share capital and reserves (continued)
(g) Retained earnings
Retained earnings comprise the undistributed profits from previous periods which have not been reclassified to any specified reserves.
(h) Fair value reserve
Comprises fair value movements on equity instruments carried at FVOCI.
(i) Foreign currency translation reserve
Comprises exchange differences resulting from the translation to Naira of the results and financial position of Group companies that have a functional
currency other than Naira.
2.18 Recognition of interest income and expense
Effective interest rate
Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly
discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:
– the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
– the amortised cost of the financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than purchased or originated credit-impaired assets, the Group estimates
future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not ECL. For purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, a
credit adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash flows including ECL.
The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective
interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability.
Amortised cost and gross carrying amount
The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial
recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between
that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance.
The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.
Calculation of interest income and expense
The effective interest rate of a financial asset or financial liability is calculated on initial recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability. In calculating
interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit impaired) or to
the amortised cost of the liability. The effective interest rate is revised as a result of periodic re-estimation of cash flows of floating rate instruments to
reflect movements in market rates of interest.
However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective
interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the
gross basis.
For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to
the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves.
For information on when financial assets are credit-impaired, see Note 2.7.2.
Presentation
Interest income calculated using the effective interest method presented in the consolidated and separate statement of profit or loss includes only
interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost and FVTOCI.
Interest expense presented in the consolidated and separate statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income includes only interest on
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
53 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
Interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the Group’s trading operations and are presented
together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and liabilities in net trading income (see Note 2.20).
2.19 Fees, commission and other income
Fee and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or financial liability are included in the
effective interest rate (see Note 2.18).
Other fee and commission income – including account servicing fees, fees on electronic products, sales commission, foreign withdrawal charges,
commission on letters of credit, foreign currency transaction fees, placement fees and syndication fees – is recognised as the related services are
performed. If a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, then the related loan commitment fee is recognised on a straight-
line basis over the commitment period.
A contract with a customer that results in a recognised financial instrument in the Group’s financial statements may be partially in the scope of IFRS 9
and partially in the scope of IFRS 15. If this is the case, then the Group first applies IFRS 9 to separate and measure the part of the contract that is in the
scope of IFRS 9 and then applies IFRS 15 to the residual.
Other fee and commission expenses relate mainly to transaction and service fees, which are expensed as the services are received.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive income is established. Usually, this is the ex dividend date for quoted equity securities.
Dividends are presented in net trading gains, or other income based on the underlying classification of the equity investment.
Dividends on equity instruments designated as at FVOCI that clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment are presented in OCI.
Income on cash handling relates to services provided to customers in processing cash withdrawal and deposits above the regulated limit, provided by the
Central Bank of Nigeria. Income is recognised as the service is provided.
Fees and commission income are recognised at point in time and over time. Fees recognised over time relate to credit related fees (concerning
participation fee and invoice discounting), guarantee fees, corporate finance fees, account maintanace fees and fees on electronic products charged
monthly. Fees recognised at a point in time include credit related fees other than those recognised over time, auction fees, commission on agency and
collection services, fees on electronic products (recognised at point in time), foreign currency transaction fees, foreign withdrawal charges and
commission on letters of credit.
2.20 Net Trading gains
Net trading gain comprises gains less losses relating to trading assets and liabilities and includes all fair value changes, interest, dividends and foreign
exchange differences.
2.21 Operating expense
Expenses are decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows, depletion of assets or incurrence of liabilities that
result in decrease in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants.
Expenses are recognized on an accrual basis regardless of the time of spending cash. Expenses are recognized in the income statement when a decrease
in future economic benefit related to a decrease in an assets or an increase of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably. Expenses are measured
at historical cost.
Only the portion of cost of a previous period that is related to the income earned during the reporting period is recognized as an expense. Expenses that
are not related to the income earned during the reporting period, but expected to generate future economic benefits, are recorded in the financial
statement as assets. The portion of assets which is intended for earning income in the future periods shall be recognized as an expense when the
associated income is earned.
Expenses are recognized in the same reporting period when they are incurred in cases when it is not probable to directly relate them to particular
income earned during the current reporting period and when they are not expected to generate any income during the coming years.
2.22 Current and deferred income tax
Income tax expense comprises current tax (company income tax, tertiary education tax national information technology development agency levy and
Nigeria Police Trust Fund levy) and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items
recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
The Bank had determined that interest and penalties relating to income taxes do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore are accounted
for under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
54 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation
and considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The Bank measures its tax balances either based on
the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method provides a better prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty.
(a)Current tax
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, and any adjustment to tax payable or
receivable in respect of previous years.
The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related
to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and is assessed as follows:
- Company income tax is computed on taxable profits.
- Tertiary education tax is computed on assessable profits.
- National Information Technology Development Agency levy is computed on profit before tax.
- Nigeria Police Trust Fund levy is computed on net profit (i.e. profit after deducting all expenses and taxes from revenue earned by the company during
the year).
-National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure is computed on profit before tax.
(b) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for: temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a
transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; temporary differences related to
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Bank is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary
differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and – taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of
goodwill.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profits will be available against which they can be applied. Future taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable
temporary differences.
If the amount of taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of
existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the business plans of the Company. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date
and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability
of future taxable profits improves.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable
profits will be available against which they can be used.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the reporting
date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset the current tax liabilities against the current tax
assets and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current
tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.
2.23 Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to
ordinary shareholders of the Bank by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Where there are shares that could
potentially affects the numbers of share issued, those shares are considered in calculating the diluted earnings per share. There are currently no shares
that could potentially dilute the total issued shares.

ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
2.24 Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group engaged in business activities from which it can earn revenues, whose operating results are regularly
reviewed by the Board in order to make decisions about resources to be allocated to segments and assessing segment performance. The Group’s
identification of segments and the measurement of segment results are based on the Group’s internal reporting line/structure to management.
2.25 Fiduciary activities
The Group acts as trustees and in other fiduciary capacities through its subsidiaries, Zenith Pensions Custodian Limited and Zenith Nominees Limited that
results in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions. These assets and income arising
thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the Group. The fees earned on these activities are recognised as assets
based fees.
2.26 Deposit for Investment in AGSMEIS
The Agri-Business/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme is an initiative of Banker's committee of Nigeria. The contributed funds is meant for
supporting the Federal Government's effort at promoting agricultural businesses as well as Small and Medium Enterprises. In line with this initiative, the
Bank will contribute 5% of Profit After Tax yearly to the fund.
2.27 Hyperinflationary accounting
Hyperinflationary accounting is applied to those subsidiary operations in countries where the three-year cumulative inflation rate is approaching or
exceeding 100%. In 2023, this affected the Group's operations in Ghana and Sierra Leone. The Group applies IAS 29 Financial Reporting in
Hyperinflationary Economies to the underlying financial information of relevant subsidiaries to restate their local currency results and financial position
so as to be stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. Those restated results are translated into the Group's
presentation currency (the Nigerian Naira) for consolidation at the closing rate at the balance sheet date. Group comparatives are not restated for the
effect of hyperinflation and consequential adjustments to the opening balance sheet in relation to the hyperinflationary subsidiaries are presented in
Other comprehensive income and reported in retained earnings. The hyperinflationary gain or loss in respect of the net monetary position of the
relevant subsidiary is included in profit or loss and separately disclosed within other operating income.

3. Risk management
3.1 Enterprise Risk Management
The Zenith Bank Group adopts an integrated approach to risk management by bringing all risks together under a number of oversight functions. The
Group addresses the challenge of risks comprehensively through the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework by applying practices that are
supported by a governance structure consisting of Board- level and executive management committees.
As part of its risk management policy, the Group segregates duties between market-facing business units and risk management functions while
management is governed by well-defined policies, which are clearly communicated across the Group.
Risk related issues are taken into consideration in all business decisions and the Group continually strives to maintain a conservative balance between
risk and revenue consideration. Continuous education and awareness of risk management has strengthened the risk management culture across the
Group.
3.1.1 Risk Management Philosophy/Strategy
The Group considers sound risk management practice to be the foundation of a long lasting financial institution.
(a) The Group adopt a holistic and integrated approach to risk management and therefore, brings all risks together under one or a limited number
of oversight functions.
(b) Risk management is a shared responsibility. Therefore the Group aims to build a shared perspective on risks that is grounded in consensus.
(c) There is clear segregation of duties between market-facing business units and risk management functions.
(d) Risk Management is governed by well-defined policies which are clearly communicated across the Group.
(e) Risk related issues are taken into consideration in all business decisions.
3.1.2 Risk Appetite
The Group's risk appetite is reviewed by the Board of Directors annually, at a level that minimizes erosion of earnings or capital due to avoidable losses or
from frauds and operational inefficiencies.
The Group’s risk appetite describes the quantum of risk that the Group would assume in pursuit of its business objectives at any point in time. The Group
uses this risk appetite definition in aligning its overall corporate strategy, its capital allocation and risks.
The Group sets tolerance limits for identified key risk indicators (“KRIs”), which served as proxies for the risk appetite for each risk area and
business/support unit. Tolerance levels for KRIs are jointly defined, agreed upon by the business/support units and subject to annual reviews.
3.1.3 Risk Management Approach
The Group addresses the challenge of risks comprehensively through an enterprise-wide risk management framework and a risk governance policy by
applying leading practices that are supported by a robust governance structure consisting of Board-level and executive management committees. The
Board drives the risk governance and compliance process through its committees. The audit committee provides oversight on the systems of internal
control, financial reporting and compliance. The Board credit committee reviews the credit policies and approves all loans above the defined limits for
Executive Management. The Board Risk Management Committee sets the risk philosophy, policies and strategies as well as provides guidance on the
various risk elements and their management. The Board Risk Control Functions are supported by various management committees and sub committees
(Global Credit committee and Management Risk committee) that help it develop and implement various risk strategies. The Global Credit committee
manages the credit approval and documentation activities. It ensures that the credit policies and procedures are aligned with the Group's business
objectives and strategies. The Management Risk committee drives the management of the financial risks (Market, Liquidity and Credit Risk), operational
risks as well as strategic and reputational risks.
In addition, Zenith Group manages its risks in a structured, systematic and transparent manner through a global risk policy which embeds comprehensive
risk management processes into the organisational structure, risk measurement and monitoring activities. This structure ensures that the Group’s overall
risk exposures are within the thresholds set by the Board.
The key features of the Group’s risk management policy are:
(a) The Board of Directors provides overall risk management direction and oversight;
(b) The Group’s risk appetite is approved by the Board of Directors;
(c) Risk management is embedded in the Group as an intrinsic process and is a core competence of all its employees;
(d) The Group manages its credit, market, operational and liquidity risks in a coordinated manner within the organisation;

ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
3. Risk management (continued)
(e) The Group’s risk management function is independent of the business divisions; and
(f) The Group’s internal audit function reports to the Board Audit Committee and provides independent validation of the business units’
compliance with risk policies and procedures, and the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework on an enterprise-wide
basis.
The Group continuously modifies and enhances its risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in markets, products and international best
practices. Training, individual responsibility and accountability, together with a disciplined and cautious culture of control, are an integral part of the
Group’s management of risk.
The Board of Directors ensures strict compliance with relevant laws, rules and standards issued by the industry regulators and other law enforcement
agencies, market conventions, codes of practices promoted by industry associations and internal policies.
The compliance function, under the leadership of the Chief Compliance Officer of the Bank, has put in place a robust compliance framework, which
includes:
(a) Comprehensive compliance manual detailing the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders in the compliance process:
(b) Review and analysis of all relevant laws and regulations, which are adopted into policy statements to ensure business is conducted
professionally;
(c) Review of the Bank's Anti-Money Laundering Policy in accordance with changes in the Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2011 and Anti-
Terrorism Act 2011 as amended; and
(d) Incorporation of new guidelines in the Bank's "Know Your Customer" policy in line with the increasing global trend as outlined in the Central
Bank of Nigeria's Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Finance of Terrorism Compliance Manual.
3.1.4 Methodology for Risk Rating
The risk management strategy is to develop an integrated approach to risk assessments, measurement, monitoring and control that captures all risks in
all aspects of the Group’s activities.
All activities in the Group have been profiled and the key risk drivers and threats in them identified. Mitigation and control techniques are then
determined to tackle each of these threats. These techniques are implemented as risk policies and procedures that drive the strategic direction and risk
appetite as specified by the Board. Techniques employed in meeting these objectives culminate in the following roles for the risk control functions of the
Group:
(a) Develop and implement procedures and practices that translate the Board's goals, objectives, and risk tolerances into operating standards that
are well understood by staff;
(b) Establish lines of authority and responsibility for managing individual risk elements in line with the Board’s overall direction;
(c) Risk identification, measurement, monitoring, and control procedures;
(d) Establish effective internal controls that cover each risk management process;
(e) Ensure that the Group’s risk management processes are properly documented;
(f) Create adequate awareness to make risk management a part of the corporate culture of the Group;
(g) Ensure that risk remains within the boundaries established by the Board; and
(h) Ensure that business lines comply with risk parameters and prudent limits established by the Board;
The CBN Risk Management Guidelines prescribes quantitative and qualitative criteria for the identification of significant activities and sets a threshold of
contributions for determining significant activities in the Bank and its subsidiaries. This practice is essentially to drive the risk control focus of financial
institutions.
Zenith Bank applies a mix of qualitative and quantitative techniques in the determination of its significant activities under prescribed broad headings. The
criteria used in estimating the materiality of each activity is essentially based on the following:
(a) The strategic importance of the activity and sector;
(b) The contribution of the activity/sector to the total assets of the Bank;

for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
3. Risk management (continued)
(c) The net income of the sector; and
(d) The risk inherent in the activity and sector.
Risk management structures and processes are continuously reviewed to ensure their adequacy and appropriateness for the Group’s risk and
opportunities profile as well as with changes in strategy, business environment, evolving thoughts and trends in risk management.
3.1.5Risk management strategies under the current economic conditions
The Nigerian Gross Domestic Product (GDP), grew by 3.4% (year-on-year) in real terms in 2025. The non-oil sector contributed 94.49% per cent to GDP
while the Oil sector recorded 4.6% real GDP. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) maintained Nigeria growth forecast at 3.2% for 2025. Global growth
is projected to hold steady at 2.6 percent this year, despite flaring geopolitical tensions and high interest rates, before edging up to 2.7 percent in 2025
26.
The first half of the year witnessed relative stability in the foreign exchange of naira against the dollar, from about N1549/U$ in Q4 2024 to 1,532/U$ as
of 30 June 2025. The CBN has narrowed the spread between the various foreign exchange segments of the market, an indication of price discovery and
improved market efficiency, thus reducing opportunities for arbitrage and speculation. Nigeria’s external reserves fell about $2.8Bn to record US$37.2
billion as at end June 2025.
On June 14 2025, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a Circular directing Banks to suspend payment of dividend to shareholders, bonuses to
Directors and investment in foreign subsidiaries until full and independently verified exit of loans granted under regulatory forbearance. Accordingly,
Zenith Bank took a bold move to fully exit the loans granted under the CBN regulatory forbearance.
The Monetary Policy Committee of the CBN at its 300th Meeting in May 2025 meeting unanimously retained the benchmark interest rate at 27.50
percent, with asymmetric corridor around the MPR of +500/-100 basis points. The Committee also retained CRR at 50% and Liquidity Ratio at 30%. The
Committee noted the need to support the naira, anchor inflation expectations, and bolster investor confidence in the Nigerian economy. We anticipate
that the CBN may continue to raise or maintain interest rates in the near term if inflationary pressures persist.
Headline inflation eased to 22.97% in May 2025, down from 34.80% reported in December 2024. The largest drivers of inflation were food (21.14%)
while core inflation stood at 22.28%. The slowdown was driven largely by recent rebasing of Consumer Price Index (CPI) and mild appreciation of the
Nigeria against the greenback.
Upside remains a stable exchange rate, recapitalization of Banks and stability in the prices of crude oil in the global commodity markets. While the
downside risk to outlook remains global trade tariff and uncertainty, currency depreciation, deteriorating security conditions, impact of declining crude
oil revenue in spite of higher crude oil prices, etc.
In spite of these challenges, Zenith Bank remains resilient and focused on maintaining its leading role in the Nigerian Banking Industry. The bank intends
to realize the opportunities that exists within the headwinds as we reassess the risk environment and operating model continuously.
3.2 Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss if an obligor does not fully honour its contractual commitments to the Group. Obligors may be borrowers, issuers,
counterparties or guarantors. Credit risk is the most significant risk facing the Bank in the normal course of business. The Bank is exposed to credit risk
not only through its direct lending activities and transactions but also through commitments to extend credit, letters of guarantee, letters of credit,
securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements, deposits with financial institutions, brokerage activities, and transactions carrying a
settlement risk for the Bank such as irrevocable fund transfers to third parties via electronic payment systems.
The Group has robust credit standards, policies and procedures to control and monitor intrinsic and concentration risks through all credit levels of
selection, underwriting, administration and control. Some of the policies are:
(a) Credit is only extended to suitable and well identified customers and never where there is any doubt as to the ethical standards and record of
the intending borrower;
(b) Exposures to any industry or customer will be determined by the regulatory guidelines, clearly defined internal policies, debt service capability
and balance sheet management guidelines;
(c) Credit is not extended to customers where the source of repayment is unknown or speculative, and also where the destination of funds is
unknown. There must be clear and verifiable purpose for the use of the funds and sources of repayment;
(d) Credit is not given to a customer where the ability of the customer to meet obligations is based on the most optimistic forecast of events. Risk
considerations will always have priority over business and profit considerations
(e) The primary source of repayment for all credits must be from an identifiable cash flow from the counterparty’s normal business operations or
other financial arrangements. The realization of security remains a fall back option;

3. Risk management (continued)
(f) A pricing model that reflects variations in the risk profile of various credits to ensure that higher risks are compensated by higher returns is
adopted;
(g) All insiders’ related credits are limited to regulatory and strict internal limits and are disclosed as required;
(h) The consequences for non-compliance with the credit policy and credit indiscipline are communicated to all staff and are implemented.
3.2.1 Credit Metrics and Measurement Tools
Zenith Bank and its subsidiaries have devoted resources and harnessed their credit data to develop models that will improve the determination of
economic and financial threats resulting from credit risk. Before a sound and prudent credit decision can be taken, the credit risk engendered by the
borrower or counterparty must be accurately assessed. This is the first step in processing credit applications. As a result, some key factors are considered
in credit risk assessment and measurement: These are:
(a) Adherence to the strict credit selection criteria, which includes defined target market, credit history, the capacity and character of customers;
(b) Credit rating of obligor;
(c) The likelihood of failure to pay over the period stipulated in the contract;
(d) The size of the facility in case default occurs; and
(e) Estimated Rate of Recovery, which is a measure of the portion of the debt that can be recovered through realisation of assets and collateral
should default occur.
3.2.2 Credit Rating Tools
The principal objective of the credit risk rating system is to produce a reliable assessment of the credit risk to which the Group is exposed. As such, all
loans and indirect credits such as guarantees and bonds as well as treasury investments undergo a formal credit analysis process that would ensure the
proper appraisal of the facility.
(a) Loans and advances and amounts due from banks
Each individual borrower is rated based on an internally developed rating model that evaluates risk based on financial, qualitative and industry-specific
inputs. The associated loss estimate norms for each grade have been developed based on the experience of the Bank and its various subsidiaries.
In order to allow for a meaningful distribution of exposures across grades with no excessive concentrations on the Group's borrower-rating and its
facility-rating scale, the Group maintains the under listed rating grade, which is applicable to both new and existing customers.
Zenith Group Rating Description of the grade
AAA Investment Risk (Extremely Low Risk)
AA Investment Risk (Very Low Risk)
A Investment Risk (Low Risk)
BBB Upper Standard Grade (Acceptable Risk)
BB Lower Standard Grade (Moderately High Risk)
B Non Investment Grade (High Risk)
CCC Non Investment Grade (Very High Risk)
CC Non Investment Grade (Extremely High Risk)
C Non Investment Grade (High Likelihood of Default)
D Non Investment Grade (Lost)
Unrated Individually insignificant (unrated)
(b) Other debt instruments
With respect to other debt instruments, the Group takes the following into consideration in the management of the associated credit risk:
i) Internal and external research and market intelligence reports; and
ii) Regulatory agencies reports
In addition to the above, we have put in place limits structure which is monitored from time to time in order to limit our risk exposures on these
securities.

3. Risk management (continued)
Zenith’s credit risk rating system is reviewed periodically to confirm that the rating criteria and procedures are appropriate given the current portfolio
and external conditions. Hence, in accordance with the Groups model risk policy, all models that materially impact the risk rating process are reviewed.
Furthermore, the ratings accorded to customers are regularly reviewed, incorporating new financial information available and the experience in the
development of the banking relationship. The regularity of the reviews increases in the case of clients who reach certain levels in the automated warning
systems. The rating system is currently undergoing external review with a view to enhancing its robustness.
3.2.3 Credit Processes
Zenith operates a centralised credit approval process system. Credits are originated from the branches/business groups and subjected to reviews at
various levels before they are presented along with all documents and information defined for the proper assessment and decision of Credit to the
Global Credit Committee for consideration. All Credits presented for approval are required to be in conformity with the documented and communicated
Risk Acceptance Criteria(RAC).
As part of credit appraisal process, the Group reviews the following:
(a) Credit assessment of the borrower’s industry, and macro-economic factors;
(b) The purpose of credit and source of repayment;
(c) The track record / repayment history of borrower;
(d) Assess/evaluate the repayment capacity of the borrower;
(e) The proposed terms and conditions and covenants;
(f) Adequacy and enforceability of collaterals; and
(g) Approval from appropriate authority.

3.2.4 Group Credit Risk Management
Zenith's approach to managing credit risk is a key element in achieving its strategic objective of maintaining and further enhancing its asset quality and
credit portfolio risk profile. The credit standards, policies and procedures, risk methodologies and framework, solid structure and infrastructure, risk
monitoring and control activities enable the Group to deal with the emerging risks and challenges with a high level of confidence and determination.
The framework for credit risk assessment at Zenith is well-defined and institutionally predicated on:
(a) Clear tolerance limits and risk appetite set at the Board level, well communicated to the business units and periodically reviewed and
monitored to adjust as appropriate;
(b) Well-defined target market and risk asset acceptance criteria;
(c) Rigorous financial, credit and overall risk analysis for each customer/transaction;
(d) Regular portfolio examination in line with key performance indicators and periodic stress testing;
(e) Continuous assessment of concentrations and mitigation strategies;
(f) Continuous validation and modification of early warning system to ensure proper functioning for risk identification;
(g) Systematic and objective credit risk rating methodologies that are based on quantitative, qualitative and expert judgment;
(h) Systematic credit limits management which enables the Bank to monitor its credit exposure on daily basis at country, borrower, industry,
credit risk rating and credit facility type levels;
(i) Solid documentation and collateral management process with proper coverage and top-up triggers and follow-ups; and
(j) Annual and interim individual credit reviews to ensure detection of weakness signs or warning signals and considering proper remedies.
The credit processes are supplemented by sectoral portfolio reviews, which focus on countries, regions or specific industries as well as multiple stress
testing scenarios. These are intended to identify any inherent risks in the portfolios resulting from changes in market conditions and are supplemented
by independent reviews from our Group Internal Audit.
3.2.5 Group Credit Risk Limits
The Group applies credit risk limits, among other techniques in managing credit risk. This is the practice of stipulating a maximum amount that the
individual or counterparty can obtain as loan. Internal and regulatory limits are strictly adhered to. Through this, the Group not only protects itself, but
also in a sense, protects the counterparties from borrowing more than they are capable of repaying.
The Group focuses on its concentration and intrinsic risks and further manages them to a more comfortable level. This is very important due to the
serious risk implications that intrinsic and concentration risk pose to the Group. A thorough analysis of economic factors, market forecasting and
prediction based on historical evidence is used to mitigate these risks.
The Group has in place various portfolio concentration limits (which are subject to periodic review). These limits are closely monitored and reported on
from time to time.
The Group’s internal credit approval limits for the various authorities levels are as indicated below.
Zenith Group Rating Approval limit (% of Shareholders' Fund)
Board Credit Committee N10 billion and above (Not exceeding 20% of total shareholders' fund)
Management Global Credit Committee Below N10billion
These internal approval limits are set and approved by the Group Board and are reviewed regularly as the state of affairs of the Group and the wider
financial environment demand.

3.2.6 Group Credit Risk Monitoring
The Group’s exposures are continuously monitored through a system of triggers and early-warning signals aimed at detecting symptoms, which could
result in deterioration of credit risk quality. The triggers and early-warning systems are supplemented by facility utilisation and collateral valuation
monitoring together with a review of upcoming credit facility expiration and market intelligence to enable timely corrective action by management. The
results of the monitoring process are reflected in the internal rating process through quarterly review of activities.
Credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with formal weekly, monthly and quarterly reporting to keep senior management aware of shifts in credit
quality and portfolio performance along with changing external factors such as economic and business cycles.
The capabilities of the credit review team is continuously enhanced in order to improve the facility monitoring activity and assure good quality Risk
Assets Portfolio across the Group.
A specialised and focused loan recovery and workout team handles the management and collection of problematic credit facilities.
3.2.7 (a) Credit Risk Mitigation, Collateral, and other Credit Enhancements
The Group’s approach to controlling various risks begins with optimizing the diversification of its exposures. Zenith uses a variety of techniques to
manage the credit risk arising from its lending activities. These techniques are set out in the Group's internal policies and procedures. They are mainly
reflected in the application of various exposure limits: credit concentration limits by counterparty and credit concentration limits by industry, country,
region, and type of financial instrument.
Enforceable legal documentation establishes Zenith’s direct, irrevocable, and unconditional recourse to any collateral, security, or other credit
enhancements.
(i) Collateral Security
A key mitigation step employed by the Group in its credit risk management process includes the use of collateral securities to secure its loans and
advances as alternative sources of repayment during adverse conditions. All major credit facilities to our customers are to be secured and the security
instruments and documentations must be perfected, and all conditions precedent must be met before drawdown or disbursement is allowed. Collateral
analysis includes a good description of the collateral, its value, how the value was arrived at, and when the valuation was made. It is usually necessary to
review the potential adverse changes in the value of collateral security for the foreseeable future.
Collateral securities that are pledged must be in negotiable form and usually fall under the following categories:
(a) Real estate, plant and equipment collateral (usually all asset or mortgage debenture or charge), which have to be registered and enforceable
under Nigerian law;
(b) Collateral consisting of inventory, accounts receivable, machinery equipment, patents, trademarks, farm products, general intangibles, etc.
These require a security agreement (usually a floating debenture) which must be registered and must be enforceable under Nigerian law;
(c) Stocks and shares of publicly quoted companies;
(d) Domiciliation of contracts proceeds;
(e) Documents of title to goods such as shipping documents consigned to the order of Zenith Bank or any of its subsidiaries;
(f) Letter of lien; and
(g) Cash collateral.
Collateral securities are usually valued and inspected prior to disbursement and on a regular basis thereafter until full repayment of the exposure. We
conduct a regular review of all collateral documentation in respect of all credits in the Bank and specific gaps in the collateral documentation addressed
immediately. Borrowers are required to confirm adherence to covenants including periodic confirmation of collateral values which are used by the Bank
to provide early warning signals of collateral value deterioration. Periodic inspections of physical collateral are performed where appropriate and where
reasonable means of doing so are available.

3. Risk management (continued)
The type and size of collateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and advances are usually a function of the nature of the instrument.
Our debt securities, treasury and other eligible bills are normally unsecured but the Group's comfort is on the issuer’s credit rating, i.e. Federal
Government of Nigeria (FGN) and other sovereigns.
As part of its Credit risk management strategy, the Group emphasizes on the robustness of its credit analysis and diagonsis prior to disbursment of loans
and advances to its customers.
The bank closely monitors the performance of its loans and advances. Once a loan shows sign of credit deterioration, the bank works closely with the
customer to salvage the situation and ensure recoverability of its loans. One major measure adopted by the bank is restructuring of credit facilities to
terms more favourable to the customer and at the same time guarantee full recovery of the loans.
Fore closure of collateral is usually the last measure adopted by the bank in the realization of its funds.The Group's policies regarding obtaining collateral
have not significantly changed during the reporting period and there has been no significant change in the overall quality of the collateral held by the
Group since the prior period. The Group did not take legal repossession of any collateral in the year.

(ii) Balance Sheet Netting Arrangements
Risk reduction by way of current account set-off is recognised for exposures to highly rated and creditworthy customers. Customers are required to
enter into formal agreements giving Zenith Bank Plc the right to set-off gross credit and debit balances in their nominated accounts to determine the
Groups net exposure. Cross-border set-offs are not permitted.
(iii) Guarantees and Standby Letters of Credit
Guarantees and Standby Letters of Credit are perceived to have comparable level of credit risk as loans and advances. In accordance with the Group’s
credit policies, banks and creditworthy companies and individuals with high net worth are accepted as guarantors, subject to credit risk assessment.
Furthermore, Zenith Bank Plc only recognises unconditional irrevocable guarantees or standby letters of credit provided they are not related to the
underlying obligor.

Examples of areas of particular focus are: gross – External data from credit reference agencies, – Utilisation of the granted limit

The Group allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of default and applying
experienced credit judgement. Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors
vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower.
Credit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases exponentially as the credit risk deteriorates so, for example,
the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades 1 and 2 is smaller than the difference between credit risk grades 2 and 3.
Each exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade at initial recognition based on available information about the borrower. Exposures are subject to
ongoing monitoring, which may result in an exposure being moved to a different credit risk grade.

3.2.12Internal portfolio segmentation
Credit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. The Group collects performance and default
information about its credit risk exposures analysed by jurisdiction or region and by type of product and borrower as well as by credit risk grading. For
some portfolios, information purchased from external credit reference agencies is also used. The credit risk grades are reviewed quarterly.
The Group employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generates estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are
expected to change as a result of the passage of time.
This analysis includes the identification and calibration of relationships between changes in default rates and changes in key macro-economic factors as
well as in-depth analysis of the impact of certain other factors (e.g. forbearance experience) on the risk of default. For most exposures, key macro-
economic indicators include: GDP growth, benchmark interest rates and unemployment. For exposures to specific industries and/or regions, the analysis
may extend to relevant commodity and/or real estate prices.
Based on advice from the Group Risk Committee and economic experts and consideration of a variety of external actual and forecast information, the
Group formulates a ‘base case’ view of the future direction of relevant economic variables as well as a representative range of other possible forecast
scenarios (see discussion below on incorporation of forward-looking information). The Group then uses these forecasts to adjust its estimates of PDs.
In determining the ECL for other assets, the Group applies the simplified model to estimate ECLs, adopting a provision matrix, where the receivables are
grouped based on the nature of the transactions, aging of the balances and different historical loss patterns, to determine the lifetime ECLs. Receivables
relate to amounts due for the povision of services to the Banks' customers. The provision matrix estimates ECLs on the basis of historical default rates,
adjusted for current and future economic conditions (expected changes in default rates) without undue cost and effort.

3.2.13Significant increase in credit risk
Significant increase in credit risk
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for exposures since initial recognition by
comparing the risk of default occurring over the remaining expected life from the reporting date and the date of initial recognition. The criteria for
determining whether credit risk has increased significantly depends on quantitative, qualitative as well as backstop indicators. The credit risk of a
particular exposure is deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition if, based on the Group’s quantitative modelling, the credit rating is
determined to have deteriorated since initial recognition by more than a predetermined range. This in turn increases the probability of default of these
facilities as a lifetime ECL is now used in estimating ECL. Using its expert credit judgement and, where possible, relevant historical experience, the Group
may determine that an exposure has experienced a significant increase in credit risk based on particular qualitative indicators that it considers are
indicative of such and whose effect may not otherwise be fully reflected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis.
As a backstop, the Group considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more than 30 days past due. Days past
due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due
dates are determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower.
If there is evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition, then the loss allowance on an instrument
returns to being measured as 12-month ECL. Some qualitative indicators of an increase in credit risk, such as delinquency or forbearance, may be
indicative of an increased risk of default that persists after the indicator itself has ceased to exist. In these cases, the Group determines a probation
period during which the financial asset is required to demonstrate good behaviour to provide evidence that its credit risk has declined sufficiently. When
contractual terms of a loan have been modified, evidence that the criteria for recognising lifetime ECL are no longer met includes a history of up-to-date
payment performance against the modified contractual terms.
Generally, facilities with loss allowances being measured as Life-time ECL not credit impaired (Stage 2) are monitored for a probationary period of 90
days to confirm if the credit risk has decreased sufficiently before they can be migrated from Life-time ECL not credit impaired (Stage 2) to 12-month ECL
(Stage 1) while credit-impaired facilities (Stage 3) are monitored for a probationary period of 180 days before migration from Stage 3 to 12-month ECL
(Stage 1).
The Group monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular reviews (quarterly) to confirm that:
 the criteria are capable of identifying significant increases in credit risk before an exposure is in default;
 the criteria do not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days past due; and
 there is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD (stage 1) and lifetime PD (stage 2).
3.2.14Modified financial assets
The contractual terms of a financial asset may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, customer retention and other
factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised
and the renegotiated loan recognised as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out in the accounting policy.
The Group renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties (referred to as ‘forbearance activities) to maximise collection opportunities and
minimise the risk of default. Under the Group’s forbearance policy, loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on
its debt or if there is a high risk of default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms and
the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms.
The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and amending the terms of loan covenants. Both
retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance policy. The Group Audit Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities.
For financial assets modified as part of the Group’s forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reflects whether the modification has improved or restored
the Group’s ability to collect interest and principal and the Group’s previous experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process,the Group
evaluates the borrower’s payment performance against the modified contractual terms and considers various behavioural indicators.
Generally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a significant increase in credit risk and an expectation of forbearance may constitute evidence that an
exposure is credit-impaired/in default. A customer needs to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the
exposure is no longer considered to be credit-impaired/in default or the PD is considered to have decreased such that the loss allowance reverts to being
measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.

3.2.15Definition of default
The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when;
 the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is
held); or
 the borrower is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the Group.Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the
customer has breached an advised limit or has been advised of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding. In assessing whether a borrower
is in default, the Group considers indicators that are:
 qualitative - e.g. breaches of covenant;
 quantitative - e.g. overdue status and non-payment on another obligation of the same issuer to the Group; and
 based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources.
Inputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time to reflect changes in circumstances.
The definition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Group for regulatory purposes except where there is regulatory waiver on specifically identified
loans and advances.
3.2.16Incorporation of forward-looking information
The Group incorporates forward-looking information into both its assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since its
initial recognition and its measurement of ECL. Based on advice from the Group Risk Committee and economic experts and consideration of a variety of external
actual and forecast information, the Group formulates a ‘base case’ view of the future direction of relevant economic variables as well as a representative range
of other possible forecast scenarios. This process involves developing two or more additional economic scenarios and considering the relative probabilities of
each outcome. External information includes economic data and forecasts published by governmental bodies and monetary authorities in the countries where
the Group operates, supranational organisations such as the OECD and the International Monetary Fund, and selected private-sector and academic forecasters.
The base case represents a most-likely outcome while the other scenarios represent more optimistic and more pessimistic outcomes. Periodically, the Group
carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of these other representative scenarios.
The Group has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for its financial assets and, using an analysis of historical data, has
estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and sectorial historical loan performance. Someof the macroeconomic variables considered
include Crude Oil price, Foreign Exchange rate, GDP growth rate, Inflation rate, Monetary policy rate and Crude production. However from the statistical
analysis of the various macroeconomic variables, the result infers that the key drivers vary across the different sectors. The macro economic variables used
across the different sectors are as follows:
 Oil and gas portfolio - Inflation, Crude production and crude prices
 Public sector Portfolio - Inflation, prime lending and crude production
 Manufacturing sector Portfolio - Inflation, prime lending and crude production
 Consumer Credit sector portfolio - Inflation, prime lending and crude production
 Agriculture sector portfolio- Crude production
 Others - Crude production
The Group has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for its financial assets and, using an analysis of historical data, has
estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and its non-performing loans.
-The Group has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial instruments and, using an analysis of
historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses.
Some of the macroeconomic variables considered include Crude Oil price, Foreign Exchange rate, GDP growth rate and Inflation rate. However from the
statistical analysis of the various macroeconomic variables, the result infers that the key drivers for its portfolios are inflation rate and foreign exchange rate.
The key drivers for credit risk for non-retail portfolios are: Crude oil price and foreign exchange rate. For exposures to specific industries and/or regions, the key
drivers also include relevant commodity and/or real estate prices. The key drivers for credit risk for retail portfolios are: Crude oil price and foreiegn exchange
rate.
The economic scenarios used as at 30 June 2025 included the following key indicators for Nigeria for the years ending 31 December 2026 to 2028.

Disclosure of estimates for a total of five periods that may have a material impact on ECL estimates
Predicted relationships between the historical loan performance of the Bank's portfolio and the macroeconomic variables have been developed by
analysing historical data over the past five years. The result of this analysis in addition to a 5-year forecast was used to determine the scalars used in
adjusting ECL.
The weightings assigned to each economic scenario as at 30 June 2025 were as follows:
Base Upturn Downturn
Corporate portfolio, retail portfolio 41% 28% 31%
Investment securities and placements 41% 28% 31%
3.2.17Measurement of ECL
The key inputs into the measurement of ECL of financial assets (treasury bills, assets pledged as collateral, due from other banks, loans and advances
and investment securities) are the term structure of the following variables:
 probability of default (PD);
 loss given default (LGD)
 exposure at default (EAD)
ECL for exposures in stage 1 (12-months ECL) is calculated by multiplying the 12-months PD by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated by multiplying
the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD.
These parameters are generally derived from internally developed statistical models and other historical data and they are adjusted to reflect forward-
looking information as described above.
PD is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon, which are calculated based on statistical rating models, and assessed using rating
tools tailored to the various categories of counterparties and exposures. These statistical models are based on internally compiled data comprising both
quantitative and qualitative factors. Where it is available, market data may also be used to derive the PD for large corporate counterparties. If a
counterparty or exposure migrates between rating classes, then this will lead to a change in the estimate of the associated PD. The methodology of
estimating PD is discussed in note 3.2.12.
LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Group estimates LGD parameters based on the history of recovery rates of claims against
defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and recovery costs of any
collateral that is integral to the financial asset. LGD estimates are recalibrated for different economic scenarios and, for lending, to reflect possible
changes in the economies. They are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using the effective interest rate as the discount.
EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Group derives the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty and
potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract including amortisation. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount at
the time of default. For lending commitments, the EAD includes the amount drawn,as well as potential future amounts that may be drawn under the
contract, which are estimated based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts. For financial guarantees, the EAD represents the amount
of the guaranteed exposure when the financial guarantee becomes payable. For some financial assets, EAD is determined by modelling the range of
possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and statistical techniques.
As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for financial assets for which credit risk has not significantly increased, the
Group measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period (including any borrower’s extension options) over which it is
exposed to credit risk, even if, for risk management purposes, the Group considers a longer period. The maximum contractual period extends to the
date at which the Group has the right to require repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee.

Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
3. Risk management (continued)
For overdrafts and revolving facilities that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component, the Group measures ECL over a period longer
than the maximum contractual period if the Group’s contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the
Group’s exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period.These facilities do not have a fixed term or repayment structure and are managed on
a collective basis. The Group can cancel them with immediate effect but this contractual right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day management,
but only when the Group becomes aware of an increase in credit risk at the facility level. This longer period is estimated by taking into account the
credit risk management actions that the Group expects to take and that serve to mitigate ECL. These include a reduction in limits, cancellation of the
facility and/or turning the outstanding balance into a loan with fixed repayment terms.
Where modelling of a parameter is carried out on a collective basis, the financial instruments are grouped on the basis of shared risk characteristics that
include:
 instrument type
 credit risk gradings
 collateral type
 Past due information
 date of initial recognition
 remaining term to maturity
 industry
 geographic location of the borrower
The groupings are subject to regular review to ensure that exposures within a particular group remain appropriately homogeneous.

3.2.19 Restructuring policy
Loans with renegotiated terms are loans that have been restructured because the Group has made concessions by agreeing to terms and conditions
that are more favorable for the customer than these provided by the Group initially. The Group implements restructuring policy in order to maximize
collections opportunities and minimize the risk of default.
The Group’s credit committee may, from time to time, grant approval for restructuring of certain facilities due to the following reasons:
(a) Where the execution of the loan purpose and the repayment are no longer realistic in light of new cash flows;
(b) To avoid unintended default arising from adverse business conditions;
(c) To align loan repayment with new pattern of achievable cash flows;
(d) Where there are proven cost over runs that may significantly impair the project repayment capacity;
(e) Where there is temporary downturn in the customer’s business environment;
(f) Where the customer’s going concern status is NOT in doubt or threatened; and
(g) The revised terms of restructured facilities usually include extended maturity, changing timing of interest payments and amendments to the
terms of the loan agreement.
3.3 Market risk
Market risk is the risk of potential losses in both on- and off-balance sheet positions arising from movements in market prices. Market risks can arise
from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and other relevant factors such as market volatilities.
The Group undertakes activities which give rise to some level of market risks exposures. The objective of market risk management activities is to
continuously identify, manage and control market risk exposure within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return on risks taken.
3.3.1 Management of market risk
The Group has an independent Market Risk Management unit which assesses, monitors, manages and reports on market risk taking activities across the
Group. The Group enhances its Market Risk Management Framework on a continuous basis. The operations of the unit is guided by the mission of
"inculcating enduring market risk management values and culture, with a view to reducing the risk of losses associated with market risk-taking activities,
and optimizing risk-reward trade-off.”
The Group's market risk objectives, policies and processes are aimed at instituting a model that objectively identifies, measures and manages market
risks in the Group and ensure that:
(a) The individuals who take or manage risk clearly understand it;
(b) The Group's risk exposure is within established limits;
(c) Risk taking decisions are in line with business strategy and objectives set by the Board of Directors;
(d) The expected payoffs compensate for the risks taken; and
(e) Sufficient capital, as a buffer, is available to take risk.
The Group proactively manages its market risk exposures in both the trading and non-trading books within the acceptable levels.
The Group's market risks exposures are broadly categorised into:
(i) Trading Market Risks - These are risks that arise primarily through trading activities and market making activities. These activities include position-
taking in foreign exchange and fixed income securities (Bonds and Treasury Bills).
(ii) Non Trading Market Risks -These are risks that arise from assets and liabilities that are usually on the books for a longer period of time, but where the
intrinsic value is a function of the movement of financial market parameter.

ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements

3. Risk management (continued)
3.3.2 Measurement of Market Risk
The Group adopts both VAR and Non-VAR (Value-at-risk) approach for quantitative measurement and control of market risks in both trading and non-
trading books. The Non -VAR (Value at risk) measurements includes Duration; Factor Sensitivities (Pv01), Stress Testing, Aggregate Open Position etc. The
measured risks are therefore monitored against the pre-set limits daily. All exceptions are investigated and reported in line with internal policies and
guidelines.
Limits are sets to reflect the risk appetite that is approved by the Board of Directors. These limits are reviewed, at least, annually or at a more frequent
interval. Some of the limits include
i. Net Open Position (NOP- for foreign exchange);
ii. Aggregate Control Limits (for Securities);
iii. Management Action Trigger (MAT);
iv. Duration;
v. Factor Sensitivities (Pv01);
vi. Permitted Instrument and Tenor Limits;
vii. Holding Period and Off Market Rate Tolerance limit.
Stress testing is an important risk management tool that is used by the Group as part of its enterprise-wide risk management. It is the evaluation of the
Group’s financial position under severe but plausible scenarios to assist in decision-making. Stress testing provides the Group with the opportunity to
spot emerging risks, uncover weak spots and take preventive action. It also alerts management to adverse unexpected outcomes related to a variety of
risks and provides an indication of how much capital might be needed to absorb losses should large shocks occur. The Group adopts both single factor
and multifactor stress testing approaches (sensitivity and scenario based) in conducting stress testing within the risk areas of liquidity, foreign exchange,
interest rate, market, and credit risks. Stress testing is conducted both on a regular and ad-hoc basis in response to changing financial, regulatory, and
economic environment/circumstances.
3.3.3 Foreign exchange risk
Fluctuations in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates can affect the Group's financial position and cash flows - 'on' and 'off' balance sheet. The
Group manages part of the foreign exchange risks through designating part of its derivatives for hedge accounting purposes and trading other basic
derivative products. The risk is also managed by ensuring that all risks taken by the Group are within approved limits. In addition to adherence to
regulatory limits, Zenith Group established various internal limits (such as non-VAR models, overall Overnight and Intra-day positions), dealer limits, as
well as individual currency limits among others limits which are monitored by the Market Risk Department on a regular basis. These limits are set with
the aim of minimizing the Group's risk exposures to exchange rates volatilities to an acceptable level. The Group's transactions are carried out majorly in
four (4) foreign currencies with a significant percentage of transactions involving US Dollars.

The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk is largely concentrated in the US Dollar. Movement in exchange rate between the US Dollar and the
Nigerian Naira affects reported earnings through revaluation gain or loss and statement of financial position size through increase or decrease in the
revalued amounts of assets and liabilities denominated in US Dollars.
The table below shows the impact on the Group’s profit or loss and statements of financial position size if the exchange rate between the US Dollars, and
Nigerian Naira had increased or decreased by 1.1% (31 December 2024: 63%, with all other variables held constant).

3. Risk management (continued)
3.3.3.1 Foreign exchange risk
A fair value hedge is used to hedge a change in the fair value of an asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment that is attributable to a
particular risk and could affect the profit or loss or other comprehensive income.
The Bank manages the foreign currency risk on a group basis and items that are subject to the same risk are managed together. The Bank has designated
its foreign currency borrowings and term deposits as hedged items in a formal hedge relationship for accounting purposes.
a) Hedged item: The Bank has hedged the NGN/USD spot exchange rate risk arising from the translation of recognized foreign currency borrowings (see
note 31) and savings and term deposits (see note 28) denominated in United States Dollars (USD) to NGN. This risk is due to the sustained depreciation
of the Naira against the Dollar, leading to revaluation losses.
b) Hedging instrument:The Bank has designated the spot component of its currency swaps with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as the hedging
instrument in the hedge relationship for accounting purposes.
c) Hedge ratio :The Bank has defined the hedge ratio as the actual ratio between the hedged item and hedging instruments. This is the ratio that the
Bank uses for risk management purposes, which is appropriate for purposes of hedge accounting. The proportion of the hedging instrument designated
in the hedge relationship is in line with the defined hedge ratio of 1:1.
d) Hedge effectiveness: An economic relationship between a hedged item and hedging instrument exists where the values of the hedged item and
hedging instrument will typically move in opposite directions in response to movements in the hedged risk. The Bank’s assessment is that gains and
losses on the derivatives attributable to the spot component will continue to move in the opposite direction to the hedged items. The currency swap
derivatives transaction was to “sell USD, buy NGN” at inception and “buy USD, sell NGN” at the forward date. A foreign currrency gain is recognised if
the Naira depreciates, and a loss recognised if it appreciates. For the hedged items - foreign currency liabilities, a foreign currrency gain is recognised if
the Naira appreciates, and a loss recognised if it depreciates. Therefore, management has assessed that there is an economic relationship between the
hedging instrument and the hedged item as they will generally move in the opposite direction.
The designated amounts and currency denomination for the hedge instruments and hedge items are also closely aligned. The Bank determines hedge
effectiveness at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through quarterly prospective effectiveness assessments. Sources of ineffectiveness include;
timing differences between the settlement dates of the hedged item and hedging instruments, credit risk of the Bank and its counterparty to the forward
contract, and the use of existing currency swaps at the designation dates. The Bank had no fair value hedge in current period.

3.3.4 Interest Rate Risk
The Group is exposed to a considerable level of interest rate risk especially on the banking book (i.e. the risk that the future cash flows of a financial
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates).The Group has a significant portion of its liabilities in non-rate sensitive liabilities.
This helps it in minimizing the impact of the exposure to interest rate risks. The Group also enjoys some form of flexibility in adjusting both lending and
deposits rates to reflect market realities.

The management of interest risk against interest rate gap limits is supplemented by the monitoring of the sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and
liabilities to various scenarios. Interest rate movement affects reported income by causing an increase or decrease in net interest income and fair value
changes.
3.3.5 Equity and commodity price risk
The group is exposed to equity price risk as a result of holding non-quoted equity investments. Unquoted equity securities held by the group is composed
mainly of the following:
(i) 6.108% equity holding in African Finance Corporation (AFC) valued at N387.6 billion and cost N40 billion.
(ii) 3.6% equity holding in Nigerian Interbank Settlement Scheme (NIBBS) valued at N1.97 billion and cost N50 million.
(iii) 2.31% equity holding in FMDQ holdings plc valued at N5.69 billion.
(iv) 0.79% equity holding in Unified Payment Services (UPS) valued at N651.97 million.
(v) 0.024% equity holdings in AFREXIM valued N664.70 million.
(vi) 5.88% equity holding in Shared Agent Network expansion facility Limited (SANEF) valued at N50 million.
The AFC is a private sector-led investment bank and development finance institution which has the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as the single major
shareholder (39.9%) with other African financial institutions and investors holding the remaining shares. The AFC operates a US Dollar-denominated
statement of financial position and provides financing in this currency.

Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
3. Risk management (continued)
NIBSS was incorporated in 1993 and is owned by all licensed banks including the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The Company is responsible for handling
inter-bank payments, funds transfer and settlement, and it also operates the Nigerian Automated Clearing System (NACS).
The Group does not deal in commodities and is therefore not exposed to any commodity price risk. The sensitivity analysis of unquoted equity is stated
in section 3.5 (c).
3.4 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the potential loss arising from the Group’s inability to meet its obligations as they fall due or its inability to fund increases in assets
without incurring unacceptable costs or losses. Liquidity risk is not viewed in isolation, because financial risks are not mutually exclusive and liquidity risk
is often triggered by consequences of other bank risks such as credit, market, and operational risks.
3.4.1 Liquidity risk management process
The Group has a comprehensive liquidity risk management framework that ensures that adequate liquidity, including a cushion of unencumbered and
high-quality liquid assets is maintained at all times, to enable the Group withstand a range of stress events, including those that might involve loss or
impairment of funding sources.
The Group’s liquidity risk exposure is monitored and managed by the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) on a regular basis. This process
includes:
(a) Projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary in relation thereto.
(b) Monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and regulatory requirements.
(c) Maintaining a diverse range of funding sources with adequate back-up facilities.
(d) Managing the concentration and profile of debt maturities.
(e) Monitoring deposit concentration in order to avoid undue reliance on large individual depositors and ensure a satisfactory overall funding mix.
(f) Maintaining up-to-date liquidity and funding contingency plans. These plans identify early indicators of stress conditions and describe actions
to be taken in the event of difficulties arising from systemic or other crises while minimizing any adverse long-term implications for the
business.
(g) Regular conduct of stress testing, coupled with testing of contingency funding plans from time to time.
The Maximum Cumulative Outflow has remained positive all through the short tenor maturity buckets. Assessments are carried out on contractual basis.
These reveal the very sound and robust liquidity position of the Group.
The Group maintains liquid assets and marketable securities adequate, within regulatory limits, to manage liquidity stress situation.
3.4.2 Stress testing and contingency funding
Stress testing
The Group considers different liquidity risk mitigation tools, including a system of limits and liquidity buffers to be able to withstand a range of different
stress events and adequately diversify funding structure and access to funding sources. Those events are regularly reviewed and monitored by the Asset
and Liability Committee (ALCO). Alternative scenarios on liquidity positions and on risk mitigants are considered. In line with standard risk management
practice and global best practice, the Group:
(a). Conducts on a regular basis appropriate stress tests to:
i) Identify sources of potential liquidity strain; and
ii) Ensure that current liquidity exposures continue to conform to the liquidity risk tolerance established by the board.
(b). Analyses the separate and combined impact of possible future liquidity stresses on:
i) Cash flows;
ii) Liquidity position; and
iii) Profitability.

ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
3. Risk management (continued)
The Board and the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) regularly review the stresses and scenarios tested to ensure that their nature and severity
remain appropriate and relevant to the Bank. These reviews take into the account the following:
(a) Changes in market conditions;
(b) Changes in the nature, scale or complexity of the Bank's business model and activities; and
(c) The Group's practical experience in periods of stress.
The Group considers the potential impact of idiosyncratic Institution-Specific, market-wide and combined alternative scenarios while carrying out the
test to ensure that all areas are appropriately covered. In addition, the Group also considers the impact of severe stress scenarios.
Contingency Funding Plan
The Group maintains a contingency funding plan which sets out strategies for addressing liquidity. The Plan:
(a) outlines strategies, policies and plans to manage a range of stresses.
(b) establishes a clear allocation of roles and clear lines of management responsibility.
(c) is formally documented.
(d) includes clear invocation and escalation procedures.
(e) is regularly tested and the result shared with the ALCO and Board.
(f) outlines that Group's operational arrangements for managing a huge funding run.
(g) is sufficiently robust to withstand simultaneous disruptions in a range of payment and settlement.
(h) outlines how the Group will manage both internal communications and those with its external stakeholders; and
As part of the contingency funding plan process, the Group maintains committed credit lines that can be drawn in case of liquidity crises. These lines are
renewed as at when due.
3.4.3 Funding approach
Our sources of liquidity are regularly reviewed by both ALCO and the Treasury Group in order to avoid undue reliance on large individual depositors and
to ensure that a satisfactory overall funding mix is maintained at all times. The funding strategy is geared toward ensuring effective diversification in the
sources and tenor of funding. The Group, however places greater emphasis on demand and savings deposits as against purchased funds in order to
minimize the cost of funding.
As part of the management of liquidity risk arising from financial liabilities, the Group holds liquid assets comprising cash and cash equivalents, and debt
securities issued by sovereigns, which can be readily sold to meet liquidity requirements. In addition, the Group maintains agreed lines of credit with
other banks.
(a) Exposure to liquidity risk
The key measure used by the Group for managing liquidity risk is the ratio of net liquid assets to deposits from customers. For this purpose, ‘net liquid
assets’ includes cash and cash equivalents and investment-grade debt securities for which there is an active and liquid market less any balances with
foreign banks and regulatory restricted cash. Customers' deposit excludes deposit denominated in foreign currencies. Details of the reported Group ratio
of net liquid assets to deposits from customers at the reporting date and during the reporting period were as follows.

agency transactions under terms that are usual for such activities.
The Group does not hold any financial assets accepted as collateral that the Group is permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of default.
3.4.4 Liquidity gap analysis
The table below presents the cash flows of the Group's financial assets and liabilities and other liabilities by their remaining contractual maturities at the
statement of financial position date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, whereas the Group manages the
inherent liquidity risk based on expected undiscounted cash flows.
The Group's loan disbursement processes are centralized and controlled by Credit Risk Management Group (CRMG) of each banking subsidiary. All loan
commitments advised to customers in offer letters are contingent on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to draw down and availability of funds.
Additionally, the Group retains control of drawings on approved loan facilities, through a referral method, where any such drawings must be sanctioned
before it is processed. This ensures that the Group's commitments on any loan are to the extent of the drawn amount at any point in time.
The liquidity analysis of lease liability is disclosed in note 29c.

3. Risk management (continued)
Liquidity gap analysis (continued)
The amounts in the tables above and below have been compiled as follows.
Type of financial instrument Basis on which amounts compiled
Non-derivative financial liabilities and financial assets Undiscounted cash flows, which include estimated interest payments.
Earliest possible contractual maturity. For issued financial guarantee
contracts, the maximum amount of the guarantee is allocated to the earliest
Issued financial guarantee contracts period in which the guarantee could be called.
Contractual undiscounted cash flows. The amounts shown are the gross
nominal inflows and outflows for derivatives that have simultaneous gross
Derivative financial liabilities and financial assets settlement (e.g., forward exchange contracts and currency swaps) and the
net amounts for derivatives that are net settled.
The Group’s expected cash flows on some financial assets and financial liabilities vary significantly from the contractual cash flows. The principal
difference is on demand deposits from customers which are expected to remain stable or increase.
As part of the management of liquidity risk arising from financial liabilities, the Group holds liquid assets comprising cash and cash equivalents, and debt
securities issued by sovereigns, which can be readily sold to meet liquidity requirements. In addition, the Group maintains agreed lines of credit with
other banks and holds unencumbered assets that are eligible for use as collateral with central banks (these amounts are referred to as the ‘Group’s
liquidity reserves’).

3.5 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
IFRS 7 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable.
Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources; unobservable inputs reflect the Group's market assumptions. These two
types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy.
i) Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
ii) Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
iii) Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The Group considers relevant and observable market prices in its valuations
where possible.

measurements of fair value. For fair value measurement in Level 3, changing one or more of the assumptions would have the following effects.

3.5.d Fair valuation methods and assumptions
(i) Cash and balances with central banks
Cash and balances with Central banks represent cash held with Central banks of the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The fair value of
these balances is their carrying amounts.
(ii) Due from other banks
Due from other banks represents balances with local and correspondence banks, inter-bank placements and items in the course of collection. The fair
value of the current account balances, floating placements and overnight deposits are their carrying amounts.
(iii) Treasury bills, assets pledged as collateral and investment securities
Treasury bills represent short term instruments issued by the Central banks of the jurisdiction where the Group has operations. The fair value of treasury
bills and bonds are determined with reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets.
The fair values of quoted equity securities are determined by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments. The
fair value of the unquoted equity is determined on the basis of the discounted cashflow methodology which takes into account the discounted stream of
estimated future income and free cashflows of the investment. Subsequently, the percentage holding of the Bank is then applied on the derived
company value. Where available the fair value of unquoted equity is determined using recent market observable data.
(iv) Loans and advances to customers
Loans and advances are carried at amortized cost net of provision for impairment. The estimated fair value of loans and advances represents the
discounted amount of amortised cost balance net of provision for impairment. The balance is discounted at current market rates to determine the fair
value.
(v) Other financial assets/financial liabilities
Other financial assets/financial liabilities represent monetary assets, which usually have a short recycle period and as such, whose fair values
approximate their carrying amount.
(vi) Customer deposits, on-lending and borrowings
The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, which includes non-interest-bearing deposits, is the amount repayable on demand.

ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
3. Risk management (continued)
(vii) Derivatives
The Group uses widely recognised valuation models for determining the fair value of common and simple financial instruments, such as interest rate and
currency swaps that use only observable market data and require little management judgement and estimation. Observable prices or model inputs are
usually available in the market for listed debt and equity securities, exchange-traded derivatives, and simple OTC derivatives such as interest rate swaps.
Availability of observable market prices and model inputs reduces the need for management judgement and estimation and reduces the uncertainty
associated with determining fair values. Availability of observable markets prices and inputs varies depending on the products and markets and is prone
to changes based on specific events and general conditions in the financial markets.
3.6 Capital management
The strategy for assessing and managing the impact of our business plans on present and future regulatory capital forms an integral part of the Group’s
strategic plan. Specifically, the Group considers how the present and future capital requirements will be managed and met against projected capital
requirements. This is based on the Group's assessment and against the supervisory/regulatory capital requirements taking account of the Group business
strategy and value creation to all its stakeholders.
The Group prides itself in maintaining a very healthy Capital Adequacy Ratio in all its areas of operations. Capital levels are determined either based on
internal assessments or regulatory requirements. The Group maintained capital levels above the regulatory minimum prescribed in all its operating
jurisdictions.
The Group's Capital Adequacy is reviewed regularly to meet regulatory requirements and standard of international best practices. The Group adopts and
implements the decisions necessary to maintain the capital at a level that ensures the realisation of the business plan with a certain safety margin.
The Group undertakes a regular monitoring of capital adequacy and the application of regulatory capital by deploying internal systems based on the
guidelines provided by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the regulatory authorities of the subsidiaries for supervisory purposes.
The Group has consistently met and surpassed the minimum capital adequacy requirements applicable in all areas of operations.
Most of the Group's capital is Tier 1 (Core Capital) which consists of essentially share capital and reserves created by appropriations of retained earnings.
Banking subsidiaries in the Group, which are not incorporated in Nigeria, are directly regulated and supervised by their local banking regulators and are
required to meet the capital requirement directive of the local regulatory jurisdiction. Parental support and guidance are given at the Group level at
which the risk level in relation to capital level and adequacy is closely monitored. The Group meets all capital requests from these regulatory jurisdictions
and determines the adequacy based on its expansion strategies and internal capital assessments.
The Group’s capital plan is linked to its business expansion strategy, which anticipates the need for growth and expansion in its branch network and IT
infrastructure. The capital plan sufficiently meets regulatory requirements and provides adequate cover for the Group’s risk profile. The Group's capital
adequacy remains strong and the capacity to generate and retain reserves continues to grow.
The Group will only seek additional capital where it finds compelling business need for it and with the expectation that the returns would adequately
match the efforts and risks undertaken.
The following sources of funds are available to the Group to meet its capital growth requirements:
(a) Profit from Operations: The Group has consistently reported good profit, which can easily be retained to support the capital base.
(b) Issue of Shares: The Group has successfully assessed the capital market to raise equity and debt. With such experiences, the Group is
confident that it can access the capital market when the need arises.
(c) Bank Loans (long term/short term): In 2014 financial year, Zenith Bank commenced capital computations in accordance with Basel II standard
under the guidelines issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria. The guidelines require capital adequacy computations based on the Standardized
Approach for Credit Risk and Market Risk while Basic Indicator Measurement Approach was advised for Operational Risk. The capital
requirement for the Bank has been set at 15% and an addition of 1% as a Systemically Important Bank (SIB) in accordance with the guidelines.

3.7 Operational risk
Operational Risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate and /or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events, including
legal risk and any other risks. Operational risk exists in all products, processes and business activities.
The Group has a broad Operational Risk management framework which defines the set of activities designed to proactively identify, assess, and manage
all operational risk components by aligning the people, technology and processes with best risk management practices towards enhancing stake holders'
value and sustaining industry leadership.
Operational risk objectives include the following:
(a) To provide clear and consistent direction in all operations of the Group.
(b) To provide a standardised framework and appropriate guidelines for creating and managing all operational risk exposures; and
(c) To enable the Group identify and analyse events (both internal and external) that impact on its business.
The Operational Risk unit constantly conducts reviews to identify and assess the operational risk inherent in all material products, activities, processes,
and systems. It also ensures that all business units within the Group monitor their operational risks using set standards and indicators. Significant issues
and exceptions are reported to Risk Management and are also identified by the independent risk function for discussion at the Risk Management
Committee.

3. Risk management (continued)
Disaster recovery procedures, business continuity planning, self-compliance assurance and internal audit also form an integral part of our operational
risk management process.
The Bank uses the following tools and methodologies in the implementation of its Operational risk Management.
Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) - This is the process whereby risks that are inherent in Business Units strategies, objectives and activities are
identified and the effectiveness of the controls over those risks evaluated and monitored bank wide. The Risk and Control Self-Assessment processes
address risks and controls comprehensively. It incorporates the process for evaluating and managing all aspects of risk that is inherent in how and where
the business is done.
Key Risk Indicators (KRI) - Key Risk Indicator is a measure which indicate the risk profile of the bank and any change thereof. KRIs act as early warning
indicators and are used to monitor and predict potential operational loss events. KRIs are used in conjunction with system of thresholds. When the
threshold or tolerance level for any KRI is breached, it triggers review, escalation, or management action. Risk indicators help keep the operational risk
management dynamic and risk profile current.
Loss Incident Reporting – Loss incidents are reported by all business units using the Loss incident reporting template. The discipline of collecting loss data
is not only needed to understand the dimensions of risk the Bank faces but also used to motivate staff to consider and more actively control key
elements of risk. The Bank-wide data collection promotes a dialogue within the Bank about determining the major operational risk exposures and
reinforces more qualitative efforts to manage operational risk within each of the business lines.
Operational Risk Capital Computation – The bank, based on Central Bank of Nigeria guideline, adopted basic indicator approach (BIA) in the calculation of
its Operational Risk Capital adequacy. The estimated operational Risk Capital Charge is reported to the Board and management for capital planning and
decision making.
Business Continuity Management (BCM)
In line with ISO 22301 Standards, the bank has a robust documented Business Continuity Plan. The primary objective of this plan is to protect the bank in
the event of an undesired event in the form of fire outbreak, flood, theft or robbery, thunderstorm, unexpected breakdown of systems, networks,
equipment, etc or any other form of disaster. This plan ensures that the bank recovers from disasters resulting in the partial or total loss of IT
infrastructure and applications to normal business operations, in a timely, effective and efficient manner. The business continuity test is conducted at
least once a year. The process is driven at a committee level but ably championed by the Risk Management Group.
Operational Risk Reporting
Periodic Operational Risk report highlighting key Operational risk identified are rendered to the Board, Management and other relevant stakeholders for
awareness and prompt implementation of mitigation plans.

ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
3. Risk management (continued)
3.8 Strategic risk
Strategic risk is a possible source of loss that might arise from the pursuit of an unsuccessful business plan. Strategic risk examines the impact of design
and implementation of business models and decisions on earnings and capital as well as the organisation's responsiveness to industry changes. Processes
and procedures have been established to ensure that the right models are employed and appropriately communicated to all decision makers in the
Group on issues relating to strategic risk management. This has essentially driven the Group’s sound banking culture and performance record to date.
3.9 Legal risk
Legal risk is defined as the risk of loss due to defective contractual arrangements, legal liability (both criminal and civil) incurred during operations by the
inability of the organisation to enforce its rights, or by failure to address identified concerns to the appropriate authorities where changes in the law are
proposed.
The Group manages this risk by monitoring new legislation, creating awareness of legislation among employees, identifying significant legal risks as well
as assessing the potential impact of these.
Legal risks management in the Group is also being enhanced by appropriate product risk review and management of contractual obligations via well
documented Service Level Agreements and other contractual documents.
3.10 Reputational risk
Reputational risk is defined as the risk of indirect losses arising from a decline in the bank’s reputation among one or multiple bank stakeholders. The risk
can expose the Group to litigation, financial loss or damage to its reputation. The Group's reputation risk management philosophy involves anticipating,
acknowledging, and responding to changing values and behaviours on the part of a range of stakeholders. Accordingly, the following are the roles and
responsibilities:
(a) Board and senior management oversee the proper set-up and effective functioning of the reputational risk management framework.
(b) Enterprise Risk Management Policy/Strategy (ERSP) is responsible for supporting the Board and senior management in overseeing the
implementation of reputational risk management framework; and
(c) Corporate Communications is responsible for managing both the internal and external communications that may impact the reputation of the
Bank.
The process of reputation risk management within the Bank encompasses the following steps:
i. Identification: Recognizing potential reputational risk as a primary and consequential risk.
ii. Assessment: Conducting qualitative assessment of reputational risk based on the potential events that have been identified as reputational
risk.
iii. Monitoring: Undertaking frequent monitoring of the reputational risk drivers.
iv. Mitigation and Control: Establishing preventive measures and controls for management of reputational risk and tracking mitigation actions.
v. Independent review: Subjecting the reputational risk measures and mitigation techniques to regular independent review by internal auditors
and/or external auditors; and
vi. Reporting: Generating regular, action-oriented reports for management review.
3.11 Taxation risk
Taxation risk refers to the risk that new taxation laws will adversely affect the Group and/or the loss as a result of non-compliance with tax laws.
The taxation risk is managed by monitoring applicable tax laws, maintaining operational policies that enable the Group to comply with taxation laws and,
where required, seeking the advice of tax specialists.

3.12 Regulatory risk
The Group manages the regulatory risk to which it is potentially exposed by monitoring new regulatory rules and applicable laws and identifying
significant regulatory risks. The Group strives to maintain appropriate procedures, processes and policies that enable it to comply with applicable
regulations.
The Group maintains zero tolerance posture for any regulatory breach in all its areas of operations.

4 Critical accounting estimate and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period. Estimates and
judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances.
4.1Impairment losses on loans and advances
Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets.
The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI is an area that requires the use of
complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour (e.g. the likelihood of customers defaulting and the
resulting losses). Explanation of the inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring ECL is further detailed in note 3.2.10 to 3.2.17.
A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as:
 Input assumptions applied in estimating probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default.
 Incorporation of forward-looking information;
Detailed information about the judgements and estimates made by the Group in the above areas is set out in note 3.2.10 to 3.2.17.
The table below shows the impact on expected credit losses on loans and advances of changes in macroeconomic risk drivers and how credit losses
respond to 10% decrease and increase in macro-variables.
30 June 2025
In millions of Naira 10% increase No change 10% decrease
Gross loans balance 8,429,165 8,429,165 8,429,165
Loss allowance 587,213 599,691 610,820
4.2Determining fair value of equity instruments
The determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable market prices requires the use of valuation techniques
as described in note 3.5(c). For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires
varying degrees of judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the
specific instrument.
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
i) Level 1: Quoted market price (unadjusted) in an active market for an identical instrument.
ii) Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly - i.e, as prices - or indirectly - i.e derived from prices. This category includes
instruments such as forward contracts, swaps etc. valued using; quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or
indirectly observable from market data.
iii) Level 3: Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs. This category includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes
inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument's valuation. This category includes
instrument that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments where significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are requried to
reflect differences between the instruments. See note 3.5c for sensitivity analysis on unquoted equity investments.
4.3Deferred tax assets and liabilities
The deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized by the Group are dependent on the availability of taxable profit in the foreseeable future to utilize the
deferred tax. The Group reviews the carrying amount of the deferred tax at the end of each reporting period and recognizes an amount such that it is
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available which the Group can use the benefit therefrom.
In determining the deferred tax assets recognized in the financial statements, the Group has applied judgement in estimating the deferred tax
recoverable in the foreseeable future. This involves the estimation of future income and expenses, and the consideration of non-taxable income and
disallowable expenses in order to arrive at the future taxable profit / loss.
4.4 Hyperinflation accounting
The results of the Group’s operations with a functional currency of the Ghana cedis have been prepared in accordance with IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in
Hyperinflationary Economies’ as if the economy had always been hyperinflationary. The results of those operations for the period 30 June 2024 are
stated in the current purchasing power using the Consumer Price Index as at 30 June 2025.
148 Zenith Bank Plc Interim Report - 30 June 2025
ZENITH BANK PLC
Notes to the Interim Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
for the six month period ended 30 June 2025
In accordance with IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’, the results have been translated and presented in Nigerian Naira at the
prevailing rate of exchange on 30 June 2025.
The Group’s comparative information presented in Nigerian Naira has not been restated.
Sierra Leone
The effects of hyperinflation accounting in Sierra Leone have not been deemed significant for group reporting purposes, therefore the Group's
operations with a functional currency of Sierra Leonean Leone have not been adjusted for the impacts of hyperinflation.
Impact of Hyperinflation
The application of the hyperinflation accounting procedures to the Group's operations in Ghana resulted in a N18.12 billion decrease in the Group profit
before tax for the period ended 30 June 2025. Included in this is a net monetary loss of N17.59 billion.
Other effects on the Group consolidated financial statements as at 30 June 2025 are:
- Total assets increased by N108.13 billion driven by non-monetary assets;
- Opening retained earnings increased by N140.58 billion reflecting the impact of adjusting the historical cost of non-monetary assets and liabilities from
the date of their initial recognition to 1 January 2025 for the effect of inflation;
- Revenue increased by NGN 2.34 billion;
The CPI for Ghana was 257.30 (2024: 248.3) with an increase in the year of 9.0 (2024: 47.8).

5. Segment Analysis
The Group's strategic divisions offer different products and services, and are managed seperately based on the Group's management and internal reporting
structure.
The Group's operations are primarily organised on the basis of its products and service offerings in Nigeria, while the banking operations outside Nigeria are
reported seperately for Africa and Europe. The following summary describes each of the Group's reportable segments:
(a) Corporate, Public, Retail Banking, Pension Custodial services and Nominee - Nigeria
This segment provides a broad range of banking and pension custodial services to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, investment funds,
governments and individuals.
(b) Outside Nigeria Banking - Africa and Europe
This segment provide a broad range of banking services to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, investment funds, governments and
individuals outside Nigeria. The reportable segment covers banking operations in other parts of Africa (Ghana, Sierra Leone and The Gambia) and in Europe
(the United Kingdom) respectively.
Segment profit before tax, as included in internal management reports reviewed by the Board of Directors, is used to measure performance because
management believes that this information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective segments relative to other entities that operate
within the same industries.
No single external cutomer accounts for 10% or more of the Group's revenue. The measurement policies the Group uses for segment reporting are the same
as those used in its financial statements. There have been no changes from prior periods in the measurement methods used to determine reported segment
profit or loss.
(c) Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The board of Directors assess the financial performance and position of the group and makes strategic decisions. The board of Directors is the chief
operating decision maker.

19. Derivative assets (continued)
b) Non-hedging derivative assets and liabilities
The Group enters into currency forward contracts with counterparties. On initial recognition, the Group estimates the fair value of derivatives transacted
with the counterparties using the discounted mark-to-market technique. In many cases, all significant inputs into the valuation techniques are wholly
observable e.g with reference to similar transactions in the wholesale dealer market. See note 3.3.4 for the mark-to-market value of these non-hedged
assets.
During the period, various derivative contracts entered into by the Group generated a net gain which was recognized in the statement of profit or loss and
other comprehensive income.

Share premium 594,113 594,113 594,113 594,113
The nature and purpose of the reserves in equity are as follows:
(b) Share premium: Premiums from the issue of shares are reported in share premium

(d) Statutory reserve: This represents the cumulative amount set aside from general reserves/retained earnings by the Bank and its subsidiaries. This amount is

reserve is less than the paid-up share capital and 15% of profit after tax if the statutory reserve is greater than the paid-up share capital. In the current period, a
total of N64.01 billion (2024: N140.42 billion) representing 15% of Zenith Bank's profit after tax was appropriated.
Other Non-Nigerian subsidiaries also make appropriation which is based on their profit and in line with the requirement of their Central Bank.
(e) SMIEIS reserve: This reserve represents the aggregate amount of appropriations from profit after tax to finance equity investments in compliance with the
directives issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through its circulars dated July 11, 2006 (amended).
The SMIEIS reserve was maintained in compliance with the Central Bank of Nigeria's requirement that all licensed banks set aside a portion of the profit after
tax in a fund to be used to finance equity investments in qualifying small and medium scale enterprises. Under the terms of the guideline issued in July 2006,
the contributions were 10% of profit after tax and were expected to continue after the first 5 years after which banks’ contributions were to reduce to 5% of
profit after tax.
The small and medium scale industries equity investment scheme reserves are non-distributable.
(f) Fair value reserve: Comprises fair value movements on equity and debt instruments that are carried at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income.
(g) Foreign currency translation reserve: Comprises exchange differences resulting from the translation to Naira of the results and financial position of Group
companies that have a functional currency other than Naira.
(h) Credit risk reserve: This reserve represents the cumulative difference between the loan loss provision determined per the Prudential Guidelines of the
Central Bank of Nigeria and the Central Bank of other subsidiaries vis-a-viz the allowance/reserve for loan losses as determined in line with the principles of IFRS
9.

38. Contingent liabilities and commitments

The Group is presently involved in several litigation suits in the ordinary course of business. The total amount claimed in the cases by and against the
Group is estimated at N2.03 trillion (31 December 2024: N1.30 trillion). The actions are being contested and the Directors are of the opinion that none of

litigations.
In arriving at this conclusion, the Group has relied on evidence and recommendations from its internal litigation group and its team of external solicitors.
b) Capital commitments
At the reporting date, the Group had capital commitments amounting to N3,378 million (31 December 2024: N1,244 million) in respect of authorized

42. Prudential Adjustments
Provisions under prudential guidelines are determined using the time-based provisioning specified by the revised Prudential Guidelines issued by the Central
Bank of Nigeria. This is at variance with the expected credit loss (ECL) model required under IFRS 9. As a result of the differences in the
methodology/provision, there will be variances in the impairments provisions required under the two methodologies.
Paragraph 12.4 of the revised Prudential Guidelines for Deposit Money Banks in Nigeria stipulates that Banks would be required to make provisions for loans
as prescribed in the relevant IFRS when IFRS is adopted. However, Banks would be required to comply with the following:
(a) Expenses for loan losses recognised in the profit and loss account should be determined based on the relevant IFRS Accounting Standards. However, the
provisions for loan losses determined under the IFRS should be compared with the loan loss provisions determined under the Prudential Guidelines. The
differences between both provisions should be treated as follows:
(i) Where Prudential Provisions is greater than IFRS Accounting Standards provisions, the resulting difference should be transferred from the general reserve
account to a non-distributable regulatory credit risk reserve.
(ii) Where Prudential Provisions is less than IFRS Accounting Standards provisions, the IFRS Accounting Standards determined provision is charged to the
statement of comprehensive income. The cumulative balance in the regulatory credit risk reserve is thereafter transferred to the general reserve account.
(b) The non-distributable reserve is classified under Tier 1 as part of the core capital for the purpose of determining capital adequacy.
In the guidelines to IFRS implementation, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) directed banks to maintain a regulatory credit risk reserve in the event that the
impairment on loans determined using the CBN prudential guideline is higher than the impairment determined using IFRS principles.
